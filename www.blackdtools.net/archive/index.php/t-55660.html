It looks that there is still few progress in obtaining cheats for the Tibia flash client. I guess it is hard to find a nice way to apply cheats there considering that here we are not working with a standard executable.

It looks that there is still few progress in obtaining cheats for the Tibia flash client. I guess it is hard to find a nice way to apply cheats there considering that here we are not working with a standard executable.<br />
Maybe it would help if everyone share here all what they know about cheating a flash game.<br />
 <br />
my investigations:<br />
 <br />
1. I have found several &quot;flash variable editors&quot; through google. It looks like you have to decompile the flash object in order to obtain the flash variable names. Then you can edit any variable you want at any time through such editors. The problem is I didn't find any open source code of a &quot;flash variable editor&quot; , but at least I know it is possible.<br />
 <br />
2. It looks like you can make an addon for firefox to deal with the flash packets going in and out. I don't really like that solution, so discarding it for now.<br />
 <br />
3. I also found that it seem to be possible to add a flash object in a VB6 app and use it to load any flash swf object. Then you can easily read/write the flash variables through the object method and properties. See http://www.cheatengine.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=180521&amp;sid=06dd5a430e622b8f8502fa0b49c345b5<br />
 <br />
read...<br />
<br />
<br />
Text1.Text = ShockwaveFlash1.GetVariable(&quot;variable&quot;)<br />
<br />
 <br />
write...<br />
<br />
<br />
Call ShockwaveFlash1.SetVariable(&quot;variable&quot;, Text1.Text)<br />
<br />
 <br />
Interesting. That looks like a better solution. Playing tibia flash inside a VB6 executable would be an great way to obtain a working bot. But I guess we need to find a way to send tibia account char/password to that flash object so it starts running.<br />
 <br />
Well, that is current progress on my investigation. <br />
 <br />
If anyone can add something more / some new ideas / some new information it would be helpfull. <br />
 <br />
Current goal: for now we need to obtain a simple working cheat for a flash client! Even if it is only an autohealer. That would be a nice start.</div></div><hr />
