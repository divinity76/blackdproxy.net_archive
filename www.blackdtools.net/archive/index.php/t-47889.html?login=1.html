	<meta name="description" content="Greetings! 
 
I hope you enjoy this script, it will bring a character to level 8 way faster than my non premium script. 
 
What it does? 
This script will take a new character and level it until it has 600 experience points. It is fully automated and no interaction is needed between the character and the person.  
 
How does it do it? 
This script will make the character hunt for food to make cash in order to buy decent equipment before starting to hunt. This is done in the FACC side. 
After it" />
