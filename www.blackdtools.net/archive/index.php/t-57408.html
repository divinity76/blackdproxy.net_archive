Here are a few things that I worked out about it: 
 
 
It learns: I set up an event to exiva dance every time it saw the words '15 minutes' - after a while, this also did not reset the timer 
Talking, Eating and Runemaking all do not reset the timer 
 
 
This is all I've worked out about it so far. If anyone knows any more than I do, feel free to post!" />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bougbear</div><div class="date">03-02-2012, 15:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like we could need to implement a truely randomised feature, or as best as we can muster anyway. I'm thinking something like moving stuff around in our bags, a combination of complex moves performed through the medium of dance, that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

I've been eating brown mushrooms, so that I eat more of them more often, but it doesn't seem to reset the afk timer. Looks like they've been working on this a while, as it was a widely requested feature on their forums</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">03-02-2012, 18:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Acording to the news ticker as long as you don't continue to hold the same hotkey it should reset it. <br />
<br />
If not it is clearly a bug as legit runemakers wouldn't do anything other than eat and say a spell... that should be enough to avoid anti idle...<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm that using more than 1 hotkey doesn't prevent logout now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bougbear</div><div class="date">03-03-2012, 00:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Have tried and tested it multiple times, and another friend on the same server got the same message but he wasn't afking, just talking and runemaking. Any others?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">03-03-2012, 08:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I got kicked when just training, talking and casting spells and eating.<br />
<br />
I have tried moving things in my bags or walking but I will try it and let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malmis</div><div class="date">03-03-2012, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">My tip: Walk five steps or more. Atleast try it for me, my runemaker does alot of stuff but mostly standing still then move like 7 steps then move back and stand still. Never even get warning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">03-03-2012, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">hard to walk when training at dummies x.x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">03-03-2012, 14:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Or just re target the creature. Press Esc and attack it again. That will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shivani</div><div class="date">03-18-2012, 15:28</div></div><div class="posttext">So it is 100% safe to use the Runemaker features in BlackD?</div></div><hr />
