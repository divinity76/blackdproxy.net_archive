Thank you very much for your vote Lith, but it is still day 23, and if I'm not wrong votes are open until day 24 :P<br />
However I don't think that I will get more votes before the contest finishes, so I will probably end in the 4th place.<br />
<br />
Anyway I want to thank you for your vote and thanks to the other people who voted for me too. Also thank you for your message, I really appreciate it man, I'm glad you liked it :)</div></div><hr />

@Gordon Anytime man, great work on the Tibia Christmas it had to be my fav for sure and the amount of work seems to be a lot more then just a snap of a picture/landscape to me. Good luck and Merry Christmas my Tibian Friends!<br />

Yeah well, it took me some time to prepare it, but its true that I've been forum member just since Dec 2011, plus I don't know anybody on this forum except Daniel, and I've also been highly retired all this year. But some other participants may have some friends here who can vote for them :p<br />
<br />
Anyway this is a contest. It's true that I would be happy if I won (now that I died and lost ~200k xD) but well, I am happy if you enjoyed my picture, so that's enough for me, and gratz to the winners (whoever finally are :D)<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas everyone! =)</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much Daniel for that 4th place prize, and thank you very much (again :)) to the people who voted for me.<br />

It was a pleasure to know that you enjoyed my picture and of course, contratulations to Thuviel, Mbynens and Ebola for their wins!<br />
<br />
In appreciation to this feedback, I will submit something in a few weeks/months for you all the Blackd community as a present to enjoy it for free (only after Daniel's approval of course :p)<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas everyone!<br />
