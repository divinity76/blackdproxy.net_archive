The reason for this is that CipSoft don't own the &quot;catcher&quot; itself. It's owned by an American company that got copyrights on it. The signed a two year contract for this and it's now outdated. The company want's 22.000 euro for a two year contract instead of the old one that cost 8.000 euro for a two-years-period. CipSoft is currently looking for coders to solve these problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-15-2010, 14:19</div></div><div class="posttext">So it seems to be. And you know why? If they cannot solve simple bugs ingame, why da heck would they be able to create their own Ban Hammer? xD<br />
Now we just need to know if in all those numbers its included name reports, spammers, hackers and all the other things...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">12-15-2010, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">if true the only thing they can use to ban people now, is to check up reports and confirm if he is botting. Whats bugs are ingame? I have not notice anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crille</div><div class="date">12-15-2010, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Trymo is a retard, see his other posts and see how ignorant he is. Also, it's not really hard to detect most bots, so I don't see why Cipsoft would need to rent a program that does their work for them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jonesman</div><div class="date">12-15-2010, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">lol i doubt his friend works for them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">12-15-2010, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">so you claim him to be a mythomaniac? I really doubt that..</div></div><hr />

 <br />
No I don't claim he has any disorder, it just seems very unlikely that what he says is true. I highly doubt someone who wants to work for Cipsoft (why else work there?) would leak such delicate info, especially if it breaks company policy which would be grounds for firing said person<br />
<br />
edit: He also claims that sending packets is enough for a bot to be detectable, which is not true until proven otherwise (given that they are sent CORRECTLY)</div></div><hr />

 tRUE true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-16-2010, 00:04</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no bugs now. But its not the first time that they know there are some kind of bug and they have no idea where it lies.<br />
This year there were a couple, i remember. One on Devorvoga and another one on lightbearer quest.<br />
I have a guide, somewhere on my computer, from a japanese (or californian? o.O) university, that explains the bot detector systems, including some mathematic formulas. It is really interesting and everything is related to the packets. I will try to find it and post the link on a new thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Found the documents. Tomorrow i will post them. Too tired to think and type xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this guy is right, all bots should be safe at this point. I finds it really intresting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kvra</div><div class="date">12-17-2010, 03:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, 14.000 euros should be really big deal for a company which earns millions a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">12-17-2010, 10:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes is should for a nonworking product.</div></div><hr />
