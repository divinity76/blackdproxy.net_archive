<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-26-2012, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the reply Zihinu~ Ill look into it right now, it was working perfectly fine the other day and I haven't switched any form of settings. Any tips appreciated, only msg I get is the; Cannot connect to a login server. Error : Disconnect from server. (200002)<br />
<br />
13:25:35 using version 27.9 , with config.ini v981 ] [Playing real servers] # internal ID 1 lost connection at DoMainLoopLogin, line 23 with error #48:File not found: crackd.dll<br />
<br />
Weird part is that when Im in the folder I can physically see crackd.dll but Im assuming it is corrupt? Will edit when un-install/installed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-27-2012, 00:56</div></div><div class="posttext">that looks like you have a bad antivirus blocking it.<br />
<br />
Fix:<br />
1 - uninstall that bad antivirus.<br />
2 - install a good antivirus instead: Microsoft Security Essentials.<br />
3 - reinstall Blackd Proxy</div></div><hr />

My brother seemed to be messing with ports last night while I was away at my girls Christmas Dinner, I un-install/re-installed a many times to no avail. Finally after discussing things with my Brother we problem solved router issues, reset my computer, un-install/re-installed a 4th and final time with the wonderful results;<br />
