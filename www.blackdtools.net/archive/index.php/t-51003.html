Im in no need of cash, and I would never have the heart to steal from someone. Im the kind of person that finds a cellphone in the street and calls the owner and delivers it back, since Im a believer that this world is not going upwards and somehow needs a little push :o<br />
<br />
Well thats it, I hope to see you all around :o</div></div><hr />
