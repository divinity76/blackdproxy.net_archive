<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-22-2006, 22:42</div></div><div class="posttext">to speak in channels it is a bit more complex.<br />
You need to use exiva &gt;<br />
and you need to know ...<br />
 <br />
channel 04 00 = game chat<br />
channel 05 00 = guild chat<br />
 <br />
There is a tutorial on the usage of exiva &gt;<br />
where you can find an example of speaking in channels through this command.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
which channel is this? :S<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i want to set, for example,<br />
if last &quot;server msg [dunno which msg it is]&quot; contains tarantula, trigger the command &quot;exiva kill tarantula&quot;<br />
or something like this;s</div></div><hr />

Since I purchased blackd about 4 days ago I still dont understand much.<br />
 So if I wanted to make my noob char sell how should I do it to make him talk in Trade channel and yell in default?<br />
oh and alarm me when i get a PM<br />
<br />
Edit: so far all i got was the following:<br />
<br />
exiva &gt; 96 05 05 00 $hex-tibiastr:<br />
<br />
but about that i just dont know were to paste it nor how to work it... I tried putting it on Events also on the &quot;?&quot; Screen and all I get were errors with the packets. If there is someone out there who can help me a PM would be more than great.</div></div><hr />
