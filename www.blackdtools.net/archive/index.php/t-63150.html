Any ideas anyone would like to share with me?<br />
<br />
P.S.: I haven't tried to use an older version of BlackD Proxy<br />

*Edit*<br />
<br />
I just tried to use BlackD Proxy on older tibia clients, and it proved to be working. Maybe it's something wrong with the configs or addresses of the new tibia clients?</div></div><hr />
