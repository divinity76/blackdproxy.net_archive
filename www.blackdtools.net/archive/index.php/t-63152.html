	<meta name="description" content="Hello. I play 7.4 ot with custom client 7.72. 
 
I'm trying to switch IDs to shoot paralyze, but in no way the changes take effect. 
 
I managed to edit the file placing it on desktop and then back to the blackdproxy folder, the file has changed but the changes dont seem to affect the tibia client. 
Even logging as an administrator hasn't helped. 
 
I have a few questions for you: 
Is my blackd using another config.ini to run? if yes, how can I know wich one? 
Has anyone had the same problem?" />
