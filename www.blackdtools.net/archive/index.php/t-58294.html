Those things will only get you banned, not deleted. I got banned for posting in every forum, if you are tired of CIP not caring than blackout CIP do not login for 1 day June 12, 2012 from server save to server save.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course if it isn't your account, and you want it deleted who knows if the guy will use Jedi powers to make his chars not deletable.<br />
<br />
Just suggest in forums any kind of boycott, and you will get banned promptly :D Also if you do curse target a tutor i think that will get you banned faster. That is only temp though, so really go hard and try to get 3 reasons to ban, trust me they banned me within 24 hours just for posting this.<br />
