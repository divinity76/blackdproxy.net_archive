Then I tried to open the Client trough the proxy but it opened the 9.6 client and not the one I selected. This is very strange in my eyes to maybe someone had the same problem and solved it or maybe some genius is gonna see this and help me. I have windows 7 btw.<br />

Thanks in advance and I'm hoping for a fast reply</div></div><hr />

From my experience, blackd only really works with the original tibia client and has issues with custom ones. If you can use the regular client, just do a search for the version that they need and you can use Blackd with it just fine.</div></div><hr />
