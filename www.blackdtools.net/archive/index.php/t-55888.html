I hope this increases the number of visitors in my web a bit.  
Anyways Blackd Proxy will be ready in around 1 week. I am sure that will bump my web back to first positions. I should remember that it will be free and open source too :)" />

And will you make a purchasable version with more cheating options later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">07-16-2011, 02:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I will try to keep my tools updated while Tibia C++ keeps being updated. I hope the new users will help a bit with the updating.<br />
 <br />
At this moment I don't have plans of making any purchasable version of my current bots. I will just give them for free. For now I only want to get a lot of visitors in my web.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RasoiR</div><div class="date">07-16-2011, 23:20</div></div><div class="posttext">You write that u gonna update bsc but you didnt answer the question about more cheats in it like cavebot etc. ;] So i am asking you will you try to add it? Do you think about layout/menu; cuz I think Tibia Auto's menu is the best (very simple for newbie users)?<br />
Mayby dont send cash back for vailid licenses just make them vailid for 100 years like the old ones.</div></div><hr />
