<br />
Will you be checking his code? For... Erm.... Unmentionables?</div></div><hr />

<br />
After thinking about it for 23 seconds, I think there's no need to worry. Specially if Blackd only receives the code and compiles it himself.</div></div><hr />

don't worry, yes, yes he will. :p</div></div><hr />

what may be unnecessary for a knight may be required for a mage..<br />
what stuff do you think is &quot;unnecessary&quot; <br />
anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">01-21-2012, 12:12</div></div><div class="posttext">You could simplify some functions. For example, a command that will &quot;use&quot; the object at a certain location.<br />
<br />
Lets see the case for opening a simple door: http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?54377-advanced-scripters-How-to-open-doors-safely<br />
<br />
This procedure, in my opinion takes too long. Perhaps you could create a function similar to the one that makes the character walk. Therefor, when it is called, it would capture the x,y,z coordinates and generate a single line at the cavebot, like &quot;opendoor x y z&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think that these are the small improvements that Blackd Proxy needs to make it simpler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xRafinha</div><div class="date">01-23-2012, 23:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for exemple the window Cheats, there is a loot of things that are useless today, the cavbot window is also confusing (not for me cuz i have been using this bot for years) but to new players... take neobot for exemple.</div></div><hr />

 a function to &quot;use a item at a specific spot only if that item is actually there&quot; sounds like a good idea (btw a closed door and a open door is 2 different items, technically. :p)<br />
<br />
<br />
Well for exemple the window Cheats, there is a loot of things that are useless today, the cavbot window is also confusing (not for me cuz i have been using this bot for years) but to new players... take neobot for exemple.<br />
i still don't understand what is useless... tell me, what functions are useless? (btw if it makes you happy, retryAttacks will be removed soon :p)<br />
<br />
also.. @confusing: if there was time for it, the whole script thing would be remade in lua...<br />
blackd has been thinking about it, at least.. but implementing lua scripting would require allot hard work and many hours of coding..</div></div><hr />
