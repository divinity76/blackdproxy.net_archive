Haven't been playing tibia for 5 years. Had some time to spend now so I started to play again on one of my accounts created in 2009. It only had 2 chars, one level 8 knight with 75/75 skills. 
 
I remember the goal was to reach 100/100. I wanted to have atleast 90/90 before I started to play seriously, so I got some spellwands took level 10 and found a empty spot noone could find, really proud of this spot to be honest.  
 
The character was online perhaps 16-17 hours per day. I work night" />

Haven't been playing tibia for 5 years. Had some time to spend now so I started to play again on one of my accounts created in 2009. It only had 2 chars, one level 8 knight with 75/75 skills.<br />
<br />
I remember the goal was to reach 100/100. I wanted to have atleast 90/90 before I started to play seriously, so I got some spellwands took level 10 and found a empty spot noone could find, really proud of this spot to be honest. <br />
<br />
The character was online perhaps 16-17 hours per day. I work night so I sleep during the day, which after the serversave kick at 10:00 the char continued to be offline untill I woke up at like 13-15:00. Had 8 soft boots on it which I manually replaced.<br />
<br />
I only used Cheatlyzer, nothing else. It had good randomized numbers casted exura ico somewhere between 67-100 mana and only moved the anti afk once per 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
None has ever visited me at my spot. <br />
<br />
Today after the extended serversave I logged in, noticed that cheatlyzer wasn't working didn't recognize the char/client so I just closed it, logged in without it and just trained manually casting just a few exura ico while browsing the web. I didn't attack the mad sheep cause I wanted to catch up 2-3% with the shielding to be exactly the same %.... Same hotkeys used as Cheatlyzer.<br />
<br />
After about 5 minutes looking at some stupid shit on a website, I minimized the browser only to read this message; character doesn't exist. <br />
https://i.imgsafe.org/9f0a33cac1.jpeg<br />
<br />
<br />
I clicked down that popup and tried to login, acc/pass isn't correct. I thought I was hacked or some shit, went to tibias website searched for the char and it really doesn't exist anymore. Tried to use the lost account but it just says that &quot;this account cannot be recovered&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad now, had high hopes actually starting to play manually for real again after all these years. I guess I'll say good bye to this game for good now!<br />
<br />
I have never been deleted before, never even a warning. Hell I haven't been banned even for player killing. And I've been around since 2001.<br />
<br />
Is this the way it works? Am I really deleted for good now? Do they just delete the account without even sending a mail to me informing me of the action taken? Isn't that really stupid? I get that I did wrong, but come on, let's say I've been online every day the last 15 years and paid the premium supporting CipSoft in every way and all of a sudden something like this happens? What if my account has been compromised? <br />
<br />
I guess some of you might laugh at this, cause this must happen all the time. But really, is this how it works? Is there any way for me to get the character/account back?<br />
<br />
Why should I start to play another character now? Why should I start seriously to powergame a character spending my time night and day doing sacrifices only to be successful in a game were I can get deleted without notice whenever they feel like it?</div></div><hr />

I don't really think they can automatically detect this software. Anyways there is always some deletion risk when cheating at Tibia.</div></div><hr />
