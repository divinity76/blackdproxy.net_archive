Work in progress guys! I've not stopped developing this. That's just early version of this ;) 
 
Hello guys. 
 
It's been a while since I'm reading this forums, and I've finally decided to create my own profile and share something with You too :) 
I'm talking about medivia OTS, they've changed their client to &quot;unhackable&quot; one (sure sure), and looks like all bots that receive and send packets are dead for now, and I haven't seen any botter arround for a while. Let's fix" />

<br />
Hello guys.<br />
<br />
It's been a while since I'm reading this forums, and I've finally decided to create my own profile and share something with You too :)<br />
I'm talking about medivia OTS, they've changed their client to &quot;unhackable&quot; one (sure sure), and looks like all bots that receive and send packets are dead for now, and I haven't seen any botter arround for a while. Let's fix this!<br />
<br />
Basicaly this bot is in AutoIT v3. What it does is emulating mouse movement, and it sometimes hacks memory (method like in cheat engine pointers) to provide You some basic lighthack.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Requirements<br />
I'm not sure at the moment, but I bet You should have autoit 3 installed.<br />
<br />
2. Installation<br />
Just extract the archive in any folder anywhere.<br />
<br />
3. Running<br />
Run mediviahelper.exe from main directory<br />
<br />
4. Notes<br />
must have net update<br />
<br />
5. Features<br />
Spear Training: Completed<br />
Lighthax: Might or might not work (depends if x32 or x64), I'm working on it<br />
Rune-Maker: Completed<br />
Botter Killer alert: Planned<br />
Gathering information about common bot killers: Planned<br />
Auto-responder: Planned<br />
cavebot works..<br />
new update will come in 15days give or take<br />
<br />

Nice that you are working on such bot and giving it out. I have made fisher and spellcaster for Medivia also in AutoIT. I wanted to develop simple cavebot just for 1-8 characters however I have few problems with it. Would you be so kind and share your source code? I would be more than thankful.</div></div><hr />
