	<meta name="description" content="Hello everyone, 
 
well I use blackd for a very long time now, i think like 3 years orso? 
Mainly for open tibia servers. 
now i wanted to get back to an old ot server i used to play Gunzodus.net. 
So i installed the Gunzodus client and set the Blackd Settings to connect to the server. 
 
Everything went well and i could log in to the server with blackd. 
But when i try to use my Hp&amp;mana settings or my Runemaker or events , it won't do anything. 
it doesn't heal me at 90% and no mana at 90% and" />

I set up the auto HP and Mana to heal my Sorcerer with exura at 95% HP, but nothing happens. :(<br />
I've tried this tool in other OT (shadowcores) and it worked...<br />
I dont know if it's an issue of the OT or the Proxy.</div></div><hr />
