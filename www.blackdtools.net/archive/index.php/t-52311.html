I have problems in doing a script which copies the name of the last attacked player of me and copies the name behind a spell. (like exori gran &quot;NAME ). 
I guess it should be possible with events. maybe copy the name in a var and if I push a hotkey send like, exori gran &quot;+var+. 
But I´m having problems in doing this. anyone can help me?" />
