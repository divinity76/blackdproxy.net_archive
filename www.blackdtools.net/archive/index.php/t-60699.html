Hello,<br />
 <br />
Tibianic is most famous old tibia OT. Until today it was possible to login just with simple 7.4 client and blackd proxy worked there perfect. Unfortunately today they updated it and from now tibianic has his own modified client. I would be really greatefull if you could take a look at that client and try to match blackdproxy to this version. I belive that it doesnt change much. They added some features in menu like show ping or built-in tibia cam. Other files have been changed just a bit and there wasnt any special change. So i belive it should be easy for You to update.<br />
Here is website where you can download that client.<br />
ip of this OT is: tibianic.org and deault port :7171<br />
http://tibianic.org/download/<br />
 <br />
I would be really greatefull if you could take look at that and try to match blackd to this client :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope he will o something and update it, i know that many people wait for that. :P</div></div><hr />
