How does an autodetection wave look?<br />
You login in Tibia and there is small fast download bar then it enters in the game as always.<br />
So, what really happened there?<br />
Tibia client downloaded a new tibia.dat without changing tibia version.<br />
Botters using outdated tibia.dat will be detected because they will be sending wrong packets (packets containing outdated tile info)<br />
<br />
I got a solution for this since Blackd Proxy 22.2. I strongly recommend to download/install this update.<br />
You don't need to touch the code. Just download latest installer and reinstall.<br />
<br />
Anyways, for curious persons, this is the main change in the code, at the connection event:<br />
<br />
<br />
     ' NEW ANTIBAN FEATURE:<br />
     ' SINCE BLACKD PROXY 22.2, WE NOW RELOAD TIBIA.DAT AT NINJA PATCHES:<br />
        If ((TibiaVersionLong = highestTibiaVersionLong) And (UseRealTibiaDatInLatestTibiaVersion = True)) Then<br />
          UpdatedDATE = GetDATEOfFile(CurrentTibiaDatPath)<br />
          If (Not (CurrentTibiaDatDATE = UpdatedDATE)) Then<br />
            ' close the rest of clients because they would be using outdated tibia.dat other way<br />
            closeAllTibiaClientsExcept ProcessID(tmpID)<br />
            ' reload tibia.dat<br />
            res = UnifiedLoadDatFile(CurrentTibiaDatPath)<br />
            If ((res = -1) Or (res = -2)) Then<br />
              MsgBox &quot;Non compatible tibia.dat file , error &quot; &amp; CStr(res), vbOKOnly, &quot;Problem with config&quot; &amp; CStr(TibiaVersionLong)<br />
              End<br />
            End If<br />
            If (res = -3) Then<br />
              MsgBox &quot;Too many tiles found in tibia.dat , please increase MAXDATTILES in your settings.ini&quot; &amp; CStr(res), vbOKOnly, &quot;Problem with config&quot; &amp; CStr(TibiaVersionLong)<br />
              End<br />
            End If<br />
            If (res = -4) Then<br />
              MsgBox &quot;Outstanding error -4 while reading tibia.dat: &quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; DBGtileError, vbOKOnly, &quot;Problem with config&quot; &amp; CStr(TibiaVersionLong)<br />
              End<br />
            End If<br />
            If (res = -5) Then<br />
              MsgBox &quot;Bug caught: &quot; &amp; vbCrLf &amp; DBGtileError, vbOKOnly, &quot;Debug report&quot;<br />
              End<br />
            End If<br />
            frmMenu.Caption = &quot;Updated Tibia.dat : &quot; &amp; CStr(UpdatedDATE)<br />
          End If<br />
        End If<br />
<br />
<br />
This update tibia.dat on the fly for the current client being connected to the game. Before that it also will close the rest of your mc clients for security reasons (to ensure everything will be using updated tibia.dat from that moment)<br />
<br />
Does this mean Blackd Proxy is completely safe now? I don't know. MAYBE it is now safe, but I won't guarantee that yet. In any case with this patch Blackd Proxy it is now a bit safer (it won't be sending outdated packets now)<br />
<br />
Anyways I will keep doing tests until I am sure it is completely safe again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't worry. You don't need to touch the code. Just download latest installer and reinstall it.<br />
<br />
Blackd Proxy 22.2+ will be able to detect tibia.dat ninja updates and it will also update tile info on the fly like real tibia does = no more bad packets containing outdated tiles = you will be safer.<br />
<br />
Future ninja patches: you won't need to download any updated version.<br />
Future big patches: you still will need to download an updated version, but that won't be a safety problem for you because cheats won't work at all until you update Blackd Proxy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, I must insist in this point: if there is any other small thing I am missing to fix then Blackd Proxy might be still unsafe. I don't know yet.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't always happen so I guess it is overlooked.<br />

So blackd is safe to use blackd safe cheats?¿</div></div><hr />

I am talking about my big bot, Blackd Proxy, the one that contains the cavebot feature.<br />
<br />
Will you get a ban if you played Tibia today with the outdated Blackd Proxy? <br />
- if you did not use cavebot then I am almost sure you was NOT detected.<br />
- If you used cavebot, then you was detected, no doubt. Anyways I think the deletion system only deletes people randomly from the list they detected. Maybe you are lucky, maybe not.</div></div><hr />

That happens to avoid that you run mc clients with outdated tibia.dat. Fix: after this happens just close everything (including blackd proxy) and load blackd proxy and tibia mcs again. Blackd Proxy won't close them now.</div></div><hr />

Something failed when trying to read tibia.dat at program files\tibia\tibia.dat<br />
It might be a permission problem. Anyways first try reloading blackd proxy and try again. If that does not work then reinstall Blackd Proxy as admin. If that does not work then drop your windows vista/7 account security level at control panel&gt; user accounts and then restart computer.<br />
<br />
I forgot: please ensure you installed Tibia in default folder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't worry. Blackd Proxy will continue to be free, safe or not. You can be sure of that.<br />
If I have to sell something in the future that will be a small optional feature or a small pack of premium advantages, but there are low chances of that happening anyways.<br />
<br />
Bot might be safe now, but I won't know until I see my test chars surviving to several ban waves.</div></div><hr />

1. Re-Install tibia in the good folder ( /c/programfile/tibia ...)<br />
2. Then Run it once (log in) <br />
3. Log out and make sure it is closed.<br />
4. Run the bot and Hope \o/<br />

It isn't 100% safe yet....<br />
<br />
I hope your not using cavebot when we have no idea if anything else is detectable. Oh please don't come back at banwave and complain if your deleted...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-19-2012, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">right... it is not really a good idea to use it in a char level 140 at this moment. As I already said, I don't know if my last fixes were enough to make it 100% safe yet. You are taking a serious risk there. I only can recommend it for low level chars at this moment. <br />
<br />
If Cipsoft detects you, they will delete you directly, even if you are premium.</div></div><hr />

there are small updates almost daily. However blackd proxy already do instant autoupdates in such small things so it should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
Now I am working on many additional fixes to avoid autodetection.<br />
Everybody is helping with many usefull reports. Thank you!<br />
And special thanks to Hans Henrik who is helping with the code. He have made a lot of improvements that I need to review and test before releasing the next version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this moment the only bot that I can recommend for a high level char is Blackd Safe Cheats. Every user survived to all ban waves so far. <br />
<br />
Of course this *might* change in the future, so never read my words as a contract that grants you any compensation in case of deletion. I will never give any compensation for deletions!</div></div><hr />
