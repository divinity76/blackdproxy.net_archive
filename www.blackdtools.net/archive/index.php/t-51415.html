Tell us your name so we can teach you.<br />
<br />
There is a no-stats kind of game so you can do any shit you want and that won't go to your stats...</div></div><hr />

Ye thats true but then again i'm pretty greedy so i feel that it would be waste playing such game if i would win :/ Anyways my name is Razoor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kvra</div><div class="date">07-11-2010, 22:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Just play supporter heroes (those goes as intelligence ones) until you learn how to play as a killer one. Try to stay back and last-hit and deny creeps as much as you can. Don't auto-attack creeps, unless you are about to take a tower down.<br />
<br />
Well, there are plenty of guides in how to play hon on hon forums anyway. Just take a peek there.</div></div><hr />

Try to follow the tutorial, it's quite good.<br />
<br />
We could make a clan, what do you think? [BDP] or something...</div></div><hr />

Sounds good, i'm just going for no stats games until i find a hero that fits me ~ :)<br />
<br />
I'm alright with soul stealer but still i want to learn to play more heroes :P</div></div><hr />

Some newbie friendly: Predator, Valkyrie, Swiftblade(good one), Maliken, Arachna, Pyromancer, Chronos.<br />
<br />
I think playing isn't the most difficult thing in this game, I'd say it's the item sinergy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kvra</div><div class="date">07-12-2010, 01:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Valk isn't noob friendly. <br />
<br />
But still, Soul Stealer isn't a newbie hero. I would say there's a lot more of heroes who doesn't quite require a lot of skills or fast reactions to play with.<br />
<br />
I'm 1691 PSR right now.</div></div><hr />

soulstealer isnt the first hero that u try to master.<br />
<br />
try out one click heroes like plague, pyro, thunderbringer etc. easy to get frags with it you are noob.<br />
<br />
also when you start play with stats you could think about if you want an account with support or a carry account. if not just play all heroes and get bad looking stats :P<br />
<br />
and if you play public don't be mad when u play 1600+ games cause all are so big noobs there :D you need to get 1800+ to get some fun out of the game.</div></div><hr />

Whats your name ingame ? Do you play USA or EU servers ?<br />
<br />
Edit: NVM, I just checked your IP and noticed the &quot;telia.com&quot; googled for it and &quot;Telecommunications provider in the Nordic and Baltic countries, offering mobile and fixed network services. Also a major ISP.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Me and my friend has played it much. It PWNS! Hook the enemies into the towers and then decay/ulti them -&gt; 110% chance of killing the enemy. Later on if we are lvl 6 or above we teleport around and suprise hook and gank everyone &gt;:-D<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drazor</div><div class="date">09-08-2010, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">League of Legends is way cooler, even tho its slightly simpler and the graphic looks pretty childish (you get used to damn fast)<br />
if youre looking for a hardcore competition game, youre pretty well placed at HoN, but to be serious, LoL is way more fun, the whole game runs pretty fast, alot of defensive parts got removed so the game becomes way more aggressive which ends up in more fun!<br />
<br />
Played dota for so many years, but never had that much fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">10-12-2010, 21:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for a matter of curiosity:<br />
<br />
For those who play HoN, do you use any mod? I've been looking and there are some decent ones.<br />
If you do, mind telling what does it do and how is it named?<br />
<br />
Thanks ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keno</div><div class="date">10-12-2010, 23:23</div></div><div class="posttext">@Drazor - I heard about it, it's also called LoL. My 2-3 friends play it and they are quite good I think. If anybody wants to start playing it, then I can give my friends names.</div></div><hr />
