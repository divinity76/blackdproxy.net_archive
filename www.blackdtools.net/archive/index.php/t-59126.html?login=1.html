	<meta name="description" content="I was reading some forums and some guy was talking about big amounts of money being made making breads in Thais (buying wheat for 1gp each, making the bread and selling for 2gp each) 
He said he spend 70k in wheat and made 140k selling breads. 
Okay. that's kinda impossible that 2 guys make 70k breads in a day, even with the bot. 
 
That made me think: there's some alternative ways of getting money in tibia? Even if it sounds impossible/hard to do, like that example that i quoted.
