I will tell you the truth, get a DS and a PSP, and you will NEVER feel bored. <br />
<br />
I dunno why, but sometimes DS starts being boring, then I switch to PSP and whoah it amazes me :P and viceversa :P<br />
<br />
Just mod 'em to accept homebrew and run Isos and .ds games and you are game dude!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only from the Pokemon games Ive gotten more than 100 hours of gameplay, those games are really well done tho Im not a fan of pokemon, I just like the way those games are done :P<br />
<br />
Get a DS phat, should cost you around 40 bucks used, you dont really need anything more than that.<br />
<br />
For the PSP get a PSP 2000 and check beforehand that it can be hackd<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jagex</div><div class="date">01-27-2010, 07:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Lord'Paulistinha (or LP) is an elite knight on the gameworld Elera, the one who, at level 467, is the highest leveled character on Tibia. Like many other high leveled players, he's accused of botting and account sharing. He is married to Suelizinha. It is said he is currently banished for account trading, although not officially confirmed. There is a post at Tibiabr of LP shows the pic of the banishment Info and the reason of banishment seems to be account trading. NOTE: Apparently, Lord'Paulistinha has been deleted or either, tibia's character page is not working. (Check this and either confirm &amp; improve this, or delete it.)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit Records<br />
<br />
Lord'Paulistinha was the first to reach level 348 to 467.<br />
<br />
    * He was the first knight to reach magic level 11.<br />
    * He was the first level 300 to be killed in PvP combat.<br />
    * He was the first level 400 to die.<br />
    * He was also the first character to reach one billion experience points, causing the highscores of Tibia.com to &quot;break&quot;.<br />
    * He was the highest character to get deleted at level 467. <br />
<br />
edit Rumors<br />
<br />
Recently a screenshot has come up on a forum which raised the suspicion, showing his top level along with an illegal software's experience stamp on the top of the Tibia client, although this is already some time ago. He has 15 insomniacs entries on Pskonejott.com.<br />
After an polemic interview, where he confessed that he used bot, multiclient, traded account, and showed destructive behavior, it is said that he is currently banned, however this can't be confirmed due to the hidden status of his account. Source: LP ban at tibiabr</div></div><hr />

Rly? I heard it was like 10 moneymakers olol, since he had 111kk that could be true</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a almost level 500 knight would have 111k even without moneymakers. Ok, maybe not if he's just hunting frosts though..</div></div><hr />
