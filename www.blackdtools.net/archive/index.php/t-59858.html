Well, I just wrote a script to bot in Posion Spider cave in nort-west part of Rookgaard. It goes smooth as usual, but character gets stuck once in a while. It's not like stucked that I couldn't move, it's just stucked, because bot tries to step on a sqm which isn't walkable, so I thought this has to do something with the bot itself.

Well, I just wrote a script to bot in Posion Spider cave in nort-west part of Rookgaard. It goes smooth as usual, but character gets stuck once in a while. It's not like stucked that I couldn't move, it's just stucked, because bot tries to step on a sqm which isn't walkable, so I thought this has to do something with the bot itself.<br />
<br />
Well, here are two screenies I just took, the exact sqm tiles aren't actually marked, but I can do that when I get stuck the next time so I can pin point that sqm tile.<br />
<br />
It'd be nice to know, if it's solvable or if it's too much work to fix it just like that. Thanks anway @Daniel.<br />
<br />
P.S.: I've put waypoints around those 2 or 3 sqms, but it gets stuck anyway, but not everytime, like 3 times out of 10 perhaps.<br />
