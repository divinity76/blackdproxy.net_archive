turn chaotic waypoints off<br />
set follow inside tibia client and select &quot;auto chase [on]&quot;<br />
set follow inside the blackd cavebot too</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems like the char goes by the monster to the waypoint it was told to go to.<br />
I guess I could remake my waypoints but that would take way too much time.</div></div><hr />
