As I'm out of time but I always wanted to improve my projects, I just decided to open source them. 
 
I hope this helps someone and maybe the community wants to keep an eye and improve something. 
 
This is the link to github: https://github.com/Kuhicop 
 
There you can find scripts with OCR (optical character recognition), Image recognition, memory hacking, web scrapping, etc. Like: 
- 3 different tibia bots" />

As I'm out of time but I always wanted to improve my projects, I just decided to open source them.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps someone and maybe the community wants to keep an eye and improve something.<br />
<br />
This is the link to github: https://github.com/Kuhicop<br />
<br />
There you can find scripts with OCR (optical character recognition), Image recognition, memory hacking, web scrapping, etc. Like:<br />
- 3 different tibia bots<br />
- 2 web scrappers for Tibia<br />
- 1 Team Fortress 2 crafting bot<br />
- FIFA18 PC Ultimate Team bot<br />
- Black Desert timer for boss spawn<br />
<br />
1 Tibia bot is made in vb.net working with memory, 1 is made in AutoIt working with ImageSearch, and last one is being developed in Python using pyautogui.<br />
<br />
For that 2 last bots (AutoIt and Python) the goal of the project is to make a Tibia Bot easy to update by the user so you can move from one server to another one without changing the software, only the settings and images (if needed).<br />
<br />
If you make any changes to any of my codes, please make a pull request or create a new branch and I will link it to main repository.<br />
But don't make any changes to keep them private.<br />
<br />
I will try to support as much as I can.</div></div><hr />
