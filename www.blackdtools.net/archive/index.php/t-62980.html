My current search is optimized enough to search any KEY with few iterations. However, I am sure it could improved up to x2 faster by someone with better knowledge about this Qt5 structure. It looks like a very complex red-black binary tree.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-30-2016, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">I wrote my functions based on some facts I discovered:<br />
- This structure seems to use some kind of red black logic. Each node have color Red, Black or Special. The logic is somehow related in the logic that you might have to follow for the optimal algorithm. I don't fully understand this so my algorithm will analyze ALL the possible logic decisions in each iteration.<br />
- The starter item is special. It does not contain data. It only contains 3 pointers and the Special color flag.<br />
- ALL the items have 3 pointers. P0, P1 and P2.<br />
- For all the items (except MAYBE for the starter item) the meaning of each pointer will be different (maybe depending color and/or iteration step?) And -whatever is the logic behind this hell- I know that each pointer should take one of the following roles: LEFT, RIGHT and PARENT.<br />
- The PARENT pointer will point to the previous collection item. This is an interesting fact when you only want to gather full collection because in that case you only want to follow LEFT and RIGHT, avoiding parents and avoiding items that you already gathered. However, we should not discard PARENT when searching for a key. Sometimes following parent is the fastest step.<br />
- The tree is somehow sorted in LEFT - RIGHT. The only special case seems to be the starter item. <br />
- In the starter item I think you can read pointers as LEFT, MIDDLE and RIGHT. When searching a key you should start choosing the 2 pointers that better fit for your key. Then, in each iteration, you should try to obtain a smaller interval, you should decide the best pointer that follow to each of them, always keeping your goal key between LEFT and RIGHT, and choosing best pointer option depending their pointed item key values. You should consider that the key value of the root item is SPECIAL (min or max value depending if you are checking best left or best right). You should consider the value of each pointer as the key of the item it is pointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-The PARENT pointer will point to the previous collection item -- this is NOT true for the special item's P0, since that is the MIN element in my example, and his P1 points to the SECOND SMALLEST item, meaning, his next item.<br />
-Sometimes following parent is the fastest step -- while true for a small subset of items, in general this is bad practice. It is not worth following the parent if the item we want is not there, since it will lead to a full (O(log n)) search anyways. Until we understand the logic behind MAX and MIX's parents, I think this is a very wasteful step.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another issue we might want to investigate- tibia caches battlelist entries. If I have your entry, and you log out, it will still be present in the structure. When you log back in, it will update the entry you had before. This means several things:<br />
-We could use this info to avoid searching the tree altogether. Once you found an item, just store its address.<br />
-We could view cached copies as &quot;live&quot; ones. This would throw off any logic that reads the battlelist to assume your surrounding.<br />
And on this note, I could not identify any changes in a cached entry from a live one. I have no idea how tibia keeps track of them (to filter the battlelist UI), but the memory image of an entry (and its info block) stayed the exact same for several tests I ran.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im trying to understand the algorithm and I have some questions that will clarify things alot, I hope its not a burden... Ive been dying to debug this code with hope to achieve deeper understanding.<br />
<br />
1. What exactly is being returned out of [Public Function FindCollectionItemByKey] ? Do you think could post a representative short example of usage?<br />
<br />
2. [Public Function ReadCurrentAddress] vs [QMemory_Read4Bytes] , does the first check the legacy client? Im confused on why use the first one. <br />
<br />
Thanks  hope not to bother too much and thanks for all.</div></div><hr />

Collections should be fast enough, specially for Cipsoft code.<br />
Visual battlelist might be independient but it gets data from the main battlelist. I am almost sure about it.<br />
Battlelist keeps death creatures, but marks their entries with a special byte at the end of the usefull information block.<br />
And of course I don&#8217;t know the exact algorithm but I am sure my functions are optimal besides the fact that each iteration takes probably x2 cpu instructions than the native algorithms. The O(thing) does not suffer at all because this.<br />
About parents in each node: I only mean that each node A contains at least 1 pointer to P where P contains at least 1 pointer to A.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ReadCurrentAddress uses AddressPath and returns a final address only valid for your current instance of the tibia 11 client.<br />
<br />
My other memory funcions just read final adress and return usefull values: numbers or strings.</div></div><hr />

Thanks , I managed to read the battle list, I did find x, y, z, hp and visible . I am having alot of trouble finding the values for outiftColors/outfit/mounts/ do you think its somehow encoded?<br />
<br />
Is the outfit (the one on the battle list) a collection itself? or is it the protobuf number thing?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thanks for all in advance.</div></div><hr />
