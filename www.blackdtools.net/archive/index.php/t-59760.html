Thank you very much for taking the time and helping me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes</div><div class="date">12-03-2012, 02:56</div></div><div class="posttext">there is 6 wavepoints</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes</div><div class="date">12-03-2012, 05:32</div></div><div class="posttext">im telling you the number one concern is it doesn't restart over the cycle... after its done using all the mana potions it justs sits there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">12-03-2012, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe your waypoints are generally shit and it can't find the next one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes</div><div class="date">12-04-2012, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">but their is only a couple of wavepoints, and it goes from downstairs to up stairs to the bank inside the dp to the mana shop back to the dp and heads downstairs in a dp space, and wastes mana like it should but does not repeat the process and i just changed that out and still not re cycleing and its in thais is you want to try it out your self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes</div><div class="date">12-05-2012, 01:54</div></div><div class="posttext">hey forget this script i have a better idea that is more simplistic, i was wondering if u can make a script where it just puts 200 manas in my backpack. I will have a back pack lying on the floor full of mana potions 5kk worth,  while doing (exura vita) at the same time so i will never have to move at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">12-05-2012, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can stop spamming the forums that would be great! <br />
<br />
Post the script you made here and then someone can test it.<br />
<br />
I still believe you forgot to put gotoscriptline 0 at the end...<br />
<br />
Taking items from backpacks and shit require hexes (bigger risks) and is more complicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joes</div><div class="date">12-05-2012, 16:11</div></div><div class="posttext">i can assure you i did't forget to put gotoscriptline 0 at the end u seen my script with the wavepoints i posted on this thread, why dont u try this script yourself and tell me if it works, starts in thais dp. thanks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-11-2012, 11:07</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry Joes, I doubt anyone is going to try this.. zihinu was trying to help and when he said ..add waypoints here he actually meant remove his text, and put the waypoints that you need in ankrahmun.. instead you switched to Thais. First lesson is creating waypoints, way points need to be exact, especially when going up and down stairs/ladders/holes. Do a little more practice and learn the bot a little. The conditional events ( ? ) in BlackD is phenominal and Its an excellent way to mana train ( I do it all the time even on my main premium accounts ) so stick around, learn a little and be patient. People are here to help and offer advice, not spoon feed you and make every script so you can play Tibia AFK you also need to put in a little time and effort yourself friend, hope you get your mana training working.<br />
