<br />
It includes some basic features<br />
<br />
Auto eat food with hotkey (CODED BY BLACKD, NOT ME)<br />
Runemaker (of couse it can make enchanted spears, pbolts, etc)<br />
Mana waster (once you run out of soul it will cast utana vid - currently not able to define the spell but this can easily be added)<br />
AFK mode or At Pc mode. With AFK mode the Tibia window MUST be the active window otherwise it won't work. If using At Pc mode the program will simply make a small beeping sound when the mana is at the right level, in order to grab your attention. You will need to eat your food manually on this mode.<br />
Anti-AFK function. The program will automatically move your character in a RANDOM direction to face up,down,right or left. I have used this program AFK and did not get kicked by the 15 minute timer.<br />
Program log. Simply logs all actions of the bot.<br />
The program also waits between 10 and 25 seconds before casting the spell, to make it look more human.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of the program:<br />

<br />
Setting up the runemaker section is very simple:<br />
Cast - This is what spell you will say<br />
Mana - How much mana it uses<br />
Soul - How much soul the spell costs<br />
Starting soul - How much soul you had before you started the program<br />
Mage/Paladin + Promoted - Simply used for mana regen calculations<br />
<br />
Please remember. ALL CREDITS TO BLACKD FOR AUTOEATER FUNCTION. The rest was done by me.<br />
It has been over 2 years since I made a program for Tibia and they have changed the way memory is read, so I have had to program it simply on a waiting function (it waits for your mana to grow via time instead of checking the memory). Please post any requests for adding functions or any bugs you find in this post and I will see what I can do.<br />
<br />
Please, mods, BlackD. If this is the wrong section or you do not want program posted here then take it down! Code is included so you are free to check its validity.</div></div><hr />

For higher safety I have recompiled it and uploaded it to my server. I also made a sticky here: http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?57973-SAFE-Runemaker-based-in-BSC<br />
<br />
Closing this thread to avoid confusion. You can talk about this new program in the sticky thread.</div></div><hr />
