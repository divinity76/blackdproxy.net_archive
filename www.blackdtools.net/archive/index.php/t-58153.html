<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-31-2012, 14:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I took a look there and I am afraid that none of the current cheats will work in such custom client unless I investigate a bit more about their custom symmetric encryption gameclient&gt;gameserver that they included in the Tibia.dll that they injected there.<br />
<br />
But I am not really interested in investing my time there unless this kind of custom client becomes too popular, so feel free to play a bit without bots for now :)<br />
<br />
Anyways... I am very curious about this custom encryption. If would like to see the original C code that generated that dll because it is a master piece, and I would be able to learn a lot from it. If anyone knows, please contact me by email :cool:</div></div><hr />

But as I said, I won't work on that unless this client becomes too popular. -or- unless someone offers me an interesting donation for that specific work, hehe ;)</div></div><hr />

Maybe if we all chip in we could make a &quot;interesting donation&quot; ;P What would you define as &quot;interesting&quot;? ;]</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also interested, how much is an interesting donation? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szyna111</div><div class="date">07-14-2012, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't it still possible to play on that OT on not modificated Tibia client? I remember that I played on this OTS few months ago and it was possible to use Cipsoft client. On TP Forums there was even a bot which worked with that client without any problems, it included basics like runemaker,lighthack but it also had cavebot (i haven't tested it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">07-17-2012, 10:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Good ots still use unmodified cipsoft clients. Just search in google for a list of ot servers and you will find some.<br />
<br />
For other clients you can contact me by email if you are interested in paying the high cost of making a custom version of my tools. Be aware that it will be expensive for you unless you are almost rich. My time is not cheap.<br />
<br />
Well, closing this thread.</div></div><hr />
