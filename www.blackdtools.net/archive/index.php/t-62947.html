Hans told me how it should look like :http://wklej.org/id/2799949/<br />
He also said that i should write to Daniel but he didnt respond , im looking for solution so long and im still fighting , this is terrible and frustrating but im not give up.<br />
<br />
Here is his 2 message : http://wklej.org/id/2799950/<br />
<br />
Some time before if gm was invisible and u double clicked on ground where he was u could see standart message  &quot;You see BN/gm/admin ...... &quot; and we used 2 scripts ,first double clicked constantly 8 sqm around u and second which looked for information &quot;you see bn/gm etc . SO i  was sure if he tried block me and i could react, but admin have got info and there is no way for kind of this solution .<br />
<br />
We tried too stuff by white information above chat, but if someone blocks u , there is apper &quot;sorry not possible &quot; and if monster blocks u same. So its broken .<br />
<br />
Like Hans said solutions exist in source but Daniel doenst respond me , so as Hans said me &quot;make a thread of this on the forum&quot; i did and i hope someone with good heart will help me . IF u guys have contact with Daniel or someone else who cna help me please send me private message, its so important for me .<br />
<br />
Take care , good day for   u all</div></div><hr />
