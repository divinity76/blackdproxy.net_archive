For people who don't know about bitcoins, you can read more here:<br />
http://bitcoin.org/<br />
You need to download the main program there to build your wallet. That is a pocket that will hold your digital coins that you will earn later.<br />
How you get coins? There are several ways, but for me the best way is running a mining program in background:<br />
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3878.0<br />
If you are going to do mining then it is strongly recommended to join a mining team. I recommend this one, the biggest one at this moment:<br />
http://deepbit.net/<br />
&quot;bitcoins mining&quot; does not disturb with you stupid ads. Nothing bad except some extra cpu/gpu usage. It only do maths in the background and you get paid for it!<br />
A very easy way to get free tibia gold for you. Having your computer mining in background for 1 day will usually get you enough bitcoins to buy 50.000 tibia gold. (more or less depending your cpu/graphic card)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have added bitcoins to payment options in my tibia gold shop. Check it at https://blackdtools.net/tibiagold.php<br />
<br />
Updated: I have added bitcoins to payment options in the rest of my shops. Check it at https://blackdtools.net/allgames.php<br />

Updated: Now accepting 1 bitcoin as 60 EUR !</div></div><hr />

Once you manage to download your wallet, discover your recieve code and create a &quot;worker&quot; on a mining teams website. <br />
<br />
Then download your mining program and attempt to mine... But unfortunetly your CPU isnt &quot;open&quot; so you need to find out what graphics card you have and drivers and find an open gpu software file which will match your driver.........<br />
<br />
then give up :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-18-2012, 17:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I was lucky. I have a good graphic card and I had zero problems there. GUIMiner worked directly for me. It detected my card correctly and I am now mining with no problem.<br />
<br />
I must admit that starting the mining is a bit complex (you need 1 wallet, 1 mining program and 1 registration at a mining team and maybe some luck with your graphic card) but it is very easy later. You only need to link the miner program in the windows startup menu and it will run minimized everytime you use your computer, without disturbing you at all. It is good for me so far. Anyways I will buy a new card for this, a Radeon HD 6950. I checked some tables and it looks like it will pay its own cost in 6 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the idea of bitcoins tho</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-22-2012, 20:56</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, I guess it is not a good idea to leave computer running 24/7 only for this (unless you are not the one paying the power bill)<br />
I only recommend using it on background while playing or working in something. Just turn computer off after you finish, as always.<br />
<br />
btw, I am now doing 262.70 MH/s with my new Radeon HD 6950, without overcloking. I am happy with it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-23-2012, 13:46</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends of your graphic card. ATI are the best ones for this task.<br />
With my new card: 300 MH/s  =  0.04 BTC/24h = 0,28 BTC/week = 6,72 USD/week max (but it really will be like 3,36 USD because I only will use the computer around 12h/day)<br />
Yes, don't expect to become rich on this.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Random-j</div><div class="date">05-24-2012, 13:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Does this also mine on your cpu? or only graphics card? im running an nvidia gtx 460</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-24-2012, 13:55</div></div><div class="posttext">cpu mining only gives you around 1-3 MH/s. That is nothing compared to what you get with a GPU. Anyways it is *possible* to do mining with both things at same time, but I think it is not a good idea to waste your cpu for that small extra.<br />
<br />
And Nvidia cards are no good for mining, really. I am afraid you won't get more than 60 MH/s with most expensive nvidia cards. Mining with them is usually not a good business. Several forums state that fact.<br />
ATI Radeon cards are the wiser option.<br />
<br />
Btw, for Tibia players: If you don't want game lag while mining just add to guiminer the following flags: -f 60<br />
This seem to decrease the overall MH/s by -5%, but everything goes smooth like if you were not mining at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now accepting bitcoins as payment method for everything.<br />
<br />
At this moment 1 bitcoin = 24 USD = 17 EUR<br />
<br />
A few weeks mining in background can give you enough bitcoins to get some nice gold!<br />
It is worth trying it. It is free for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Satanás</div><div class="date">02-14-2013, 21:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure I've read somewhere they nerfed the mining of Bitcoins a while ago.<br />
<br />
But still, surelly it is worth trying, won't cost you about anything, and you can still get some nice gold in exchange, great news for buyers! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-15-2013, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Bitcoins are not really nerfed. Only 1 readjustement happened few months ago: the basic reward unit for solo-miners is now 25 bitcoins instead 50 bitcoins, but the payout bitcoin/RealMoney also got readjusted by market so now you earn more than double money for same time mining. And anyways solo-mining is not a good idea. It is much better to join a team and earn some guaranteed cents of bitcoins each day. With solo-mining you probably won't see any bitcoin at all in 1 or 2 years, so not a good idea anyways. Team mining is the way to go. And I always recommend Deepbit for it. You don't need to make friends or a guild for it. You become part of the team directly, with no effort and with no cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, bitcoin value keep going up: today 1 bitcoin is more than 20 EUR :)<br />
You can see bitcoin value going up here: https://mtgox.com/index.html?Currency=EUR Click in the chart icon to see the chart, then click 1m to see changes last month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bitcoin is the currency of the future. I strongly recommend everybody to try it, really. It is a strong currency, a perfect payment method, and an easy way to use your computer resources for making free money.</div></div><hr />
