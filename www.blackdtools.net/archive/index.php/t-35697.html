It would be nice if some moderator made rule adjustments about advertising too. I never had anything against posting link to your site in signature. However, recently I feel oversaturated with one site that its author put everywhere it's possible to write a string message (inlcuding scripts).</div></div><hr />

Well I'll add some point to Malmis afirmations: If you don't want your scripts to be spoiled don't sell them/release them. At least, if you're doing so, try to convince your customers that releasing the script goes against you both.</div></div><hr />
