I go straight to the point. I have two different laptops- first with Win 7, 64bits, the next one is with XP 32 bits. On the second I installed Proxy Blackd for OTS 7.72. It's work very well. This OTS has got custom client, so that's mean custom IDs of runes. But I swapped all of IDs and its work OK - I can use hotkeys like exiva uh, exiva 0 - everything. On my better laptop I have installed Blackd Proxy same like on my old laptop. Blackd proxy work right (but not all). I don't know why, but I swapped too all of IDs and I still can't use exiva uh/exiva 0...<br />

Anyone can help me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-06-2012, 22:38</div></div><div class="posttext">ensure you only modify the .ini files while blackd proxy is running. Else blackd proxy will ignore the changes and will revert the changes after it closes.<br />
<br />
- windows 7 should work correctlty, 32 or 64 bits. I made tests with both and I found no problem with hotkeys. Just ensure you don't have an antivirus or firewall blocking blackd proxy.</div></div><hr />

Antivirus/firewall doesn't block anything :/</div></div><hr />
