<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-25-2007, 11:11</div></div><div class="posttext">I think all login servers go down too often because processing a login is a very slow process, with a high cost of CPU (compared with the classic login before encryption) Now multiply that x 50000 logins (per minute) that login servers might have (without the need of any DDoS attack at all) <br />
 <br />
Tibia servers have more and more players each day, so eventually all the login servers will be always off unless they improve their their hardware, or ... unless they set an independient login procedure for each world. Because there is no real need to share 4 login servers for all the 70+ worlds with all their players. You can just login directly to a server without using a shared login server. Indeed, you do that when you change character through keys control+G (even if you choose a character of a different world) Notice that you login instantly! this is how it should work always from the first login if tibia design gets fixed.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Indeed, you can just login into your gameworld directly with control+G , once inside. And do you know what? There is nothing that blocks you from doing that from start. Blackd Proxy now allows you to do that, through this function.<br />
 <br />
You need to activate the checkbox, enter your character name (exactly) and select your gameworld. Now just login and you will get a character list from blackd proxy (not from login servers) This character list will allow the client to do the same effect than the &quot;control+g&quot; , so it is more or less legal, but still you could be banished for &quot;loged in when all login servers were down&quot; Use at your own responsability.</div></div><hr />

So, if you bypass it, you're gonna login in the server that supposed to be offline.<br />

That's my guess.<br />
Sorry if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

I tried to bypass the login servers using the Free Proxy tool,<br />
the name and world are CORRECT, but when I'm loging in the client returns a message like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;sorry. character doesn't live on this world. please login on the right world&quot;<br />
<br />
but as I've said the name and world are correct!<br />
My world was also online at that moment...<br />
<br />
So what is the problem?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zarcel</div><div class="date">02-08-2008, 00:48</div></div><div class="posttext">when you are logging into servers first you are connecting to login server that is allowing you to choose character and then the server is connecting you to world, and that function is bypyssing the login server and logging directly to the game world with your character ; ) i think the bot is sending packets that loggin server should send and emulate it with that ; p</div></div><hr />

<br />
And does it even specify anywhere that you're not allowed to use an external server for logging in? oO  It doesn't necessarily need to modify the client or give an advantage (the servers should be online to begin with), and it doesn't require blackD to do this.</div></div><hr />
