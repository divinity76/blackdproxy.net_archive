There are always ways to bypass it. The future is obviously Flash but there's a long road ahead of us, until this one is completely discontinued. Until then, will only have BlackD Proxy. Daniels words, +-.<br />
And he's right, flash client is a bit useless due to its current bugs.</div></div><hr />

I could mention a few but this is the most annoying of all: Have you ever tried to loot something in flash? Don't you usually have this problem-when you release the mouse button in your container, the loot goes back to where it was. Its like the game reads the information as if you had missed the container spot.<br />
<br />
Some other bugs, but this depends on the browser in use, if you click on the F's hotkeys, it pops up browser menus and not the game commands.<br />
Just one more, make it fullscreen and then move your cursor to the top. You'll see that the window will resize or pop up some sort of &quot;Exit full screen&quot; option. Don't you think that's annoying? <br />
<br />
Each time I play there, although those hotkeys are really cool and useful, I cant do the exp./h as if I was in normal C++ client. Besides, I don't have a fluid game even though my computer has more than the minimum specifications to run flash smoothly .<br />
<br />
I use it also for trade, its perfect there. But still, not my choice for a hunt.</div></div><hr />
