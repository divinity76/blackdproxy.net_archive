<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, first of all ... Be careful these day with botting some 'precious' accounts, cuz there have been some minor Tibia patches lately which might get you while botting if you're not completely careful. Of course, no bot is 100% safe, but if you do it as BlackD says or any old 'oldschooler' then you'll be fine ... for now. :P<br />
<br />
Now to the script. Well you could write it by yourself, but since I presume you're a new member here, you still haven't figured out how the scripts work, which is OK, I was the same running around like my head had came off.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you could go under Forum&gt;BlackD Proxy&gt;Cavebot - New scripts (safer) and search for script manually or you could use a 'search' feature at the top right corner of your screen, just a little bit under your small user interface. Now, when you're searching for scripts, be careful, some are outdated so I prefer these ones posted under 'Cavebot - New scripts (safer)' even though I have never used somebody else's script, because I always created my own.<br />
<br />
If I had pacc I'd be in Dara now making a simple script for you, but I can't, out of pacc at the moment :| ... So you'll have to find it here on forum. Some, if not all contains a 'depositer' or 'refiller' which I don't use quite often cuz I still didn't get used to it, but of course you could just delete 'depositer' and 'refiller' path and just hunt/bot until your cap if full.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now to the point how to load a script. When you find a thread with a script in it, it can be attached as a notepad file at the bottom of the first post or it can be just posted as a 'code' like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
setMeleeKill Bear<br />
setLoot 08 17<br />
setLoot 0E 17<br />
setBot OldLootMode=1<br />
move 32150,32199,8<br />
move 32155,32199,8<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
<br />
*Note that this is just a random stuff I just came up with, no real script involved here just random stuff. Haven't got any Darashia Rotworms script in my collection tho, just checked :|<br />
<br />
Ok, so when you see it like this, then you just copy whatever it's 'coded' or wrapped in 'code' feature and you just paste it in notepad and you save it as .txt file as for an example like: Darashia_Rotworms.txt; in your BlackD Proxy folder wherever you installed it. Usually my OS Vista won't let me save it right away, so I usually save it on my desktop and then I open BlackD Proxy folder and I just drag that .txt file in it.<br />
<br />
And then, if you got yourself a BlackD Proxy already running, you open a 'Cavebot' section and in the bottom left corner you 'update' the list of your scripts that are in BlackD Proxy folder and find you script among others in that list. Then you just load it and activate it with checking that little box just at the top right corner that says 'Activate cavebot' and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
I hope I've helped and that I haven't twist it in such way you now understand less than you already did. :P<br />
<br />
Of course, let me know if you got problems and just post here. I'll post a screenshots if you still can't get it to work.<br />
<br />
Cheers mate!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Cavebot isn't completely safe, in fact it might get you banned, well I haven't been banned on the last ban wave, but others were caught so be careful! Use cavebot on your own risk! I use it on my 'noob' accounts which I don't really care if they get caught!</div></div><hr />

<br />
you think it would be safe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 12:44</div></div><div class="posttext">@Robjay ... It should be safe, it's from safe section posted by BlackD himself, but of course keep in mind that it's not completely safe at the moment, just like any other bot out there ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, keep us updated how it goes! ^^</div></div><hr />
