I thought I would remind players that you can get ALL BLESSINGS (5+twist) FOR FREE. 
 
Don't go to the blessings people! Go to your local NPC in the temple (WHERE YOU SPAWN AFTER DEATH)

Hi<br />
Blessings<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
Job done :D<br />
<br />
I see people complaining all over tibia.com forums saying blessings are not free, and I know alot of users don't even check tibia.com so I thought I would post this here.<br />
<br />
Remember you can bless all your characters even level 8s for free! So if you level it in 20 years time without a death you will be level 100+ with bless!</div></div><hr />
