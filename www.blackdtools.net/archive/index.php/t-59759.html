<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jagex</div><div class="date">11-30-2012, 16:12</div></div><div class="posttext">This just opened up even more questions.<br />
<br />
Horde or Alliance?<br />
<br />
Pvp or pvm?<br />
<br />
favorite class?<br />
<br />
Do you bot on WoW?<br />
<br />
If so, is it your own private bot or did you make your own?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">11-30-2012, 19:07</div></div><div class="posttext">I always play mage in a Alliance PvP server. I never use any cheat. I don't have any bot for WoW. I am only there for fun. In a first place my nick was Blackd, but I moved server and I was forced to change nick because a Blackd already existed there. Nowadays there are more than 70 players named Blackd in WoW (in different servers) None of them is me at this moment.<br />
<br />
My current nick/server is now secret because I feel more comfortable playing anonymously.</div></div><hr />

Oh yea, I wouldn't ask for your nick on the game lol.  I'm sure you would get spammed.  Though glad to see a fellow pvp alliance player.  I bet you're frost 0.o</div></div><hr />
