<br />
Use setmelee kill MONSTER<br />
and set spellkill SPELL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DroniC</div><div class="date">08-17-2013, 11:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I know..  I said that my script looks like his script:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SetRetryAttacks<br />
setSpellKill Tsuful Civilian,ki blast,3<br />
setMeleeKill Tsuful Civilian<br />
setMeleeKill Triceratops<br />
SetMaxAttackTimeMs 40000<br />
SetMaxHit 10000<br />
setLootOff<br />
move 290,565,7<br />
move 302,565,7<br />
move 301,581,7<br />
move 317,581,7<br />
move 319,565,7<br />
move 302,565,7<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
<br />
but my bot doesn't attack monsters by meele. He's only attacking monsters by spell. ONLY. <br />
Retry Attacks only works when I change Timer for about 1200-1600, but it's wasting of time. <br />
On he's script his got timer 100-400.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using blackdproxy on a completely alted game that uses the engine of tibia is going to result in problems haha</div></div><hr />
