<br />
Oh, smart. Mine suddenly started working but I changed the foldername tibia944 to tibia945... Now I don't get any errors.<br />
<br />
EDIT: But I'll wait for an official fix before attempting to login.</div></div><hr />

I will recompile it and I will upload it. Give me 5 minutes...<br />

about attaching screenshots in forum... what format of image was you trying to attach?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried both PNG and JPEG, not just renamed but saved in different formats. Maybe size limit? But the JPEG was less than a 100KB...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-22-2012, 15:18</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, I finished uploading Blackd Proxy again. Just redownload and reinstall now and it should fix the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, I disabled it. People should not be able to use it now. If someone loads a script with chatoicmoveson then cavebot will just ignore that line.<br />
<br />
btw, I see the error with forum images. I don't know the reason yet. I am investigating it now.</div></div><hr />

My day just got alot better. :)<br />
Thank you for fast updates and support as always. During Tibia updates atleast... ;p</div></div><hr />

The image thing was some kind of problem with ImageMagick... I have changed it to GD and problem solved.<br />
Now testing attaching an image...<br />

<br />
No but seriously, I'm so glad I came back to BlackD Proxy ... I mean, fast updates, supportive staff, easy to use, well not completely safe (actually none of the bots is), but I really don't care if I get deleted on my accounts.<br />
<br />
If you'll ever decide to fully work on bot again Daniel and if you make it payable again, I'm your first customer ... for realzz.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

However I don't really have plans of selling it again.<br />
At least I am not going to sell something that it is not 100% undetectable yet, that is sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">03-23-2012, 02:19</div></div><div class="posttext">@Malmis ... :D Oh come on!<br />
<br />
@BlackD ... You're welcome! Great job! :D ... Which brings me to my next point ... \/<br />
<br />
OT: Is it possible that exp/h rate raised since chaoticmoves are fixed/disabled in latest version? Because I'm getting surprised. For example, I'm currently botting my rookie account (got premmy as a gift) and I usually get up to 6,3k exp/h on premmy side and that's at server's peak hour when the majority of people is online. Currently there are 96 players online, yeah it's 1:15 AM and people went to bed, and surprisingly I'm getting 6,8k exp/h, that's 500 exp more which is around 7,5% better ... D:?! 7k+/h at peak hour?! D: I mean, it makes hell of a lot of difference on Rookgaard. My stamina haven't been completely full for at least a month now, so no, it's not a happy hour and my scripts didn't contain 'ChaotiMovesON' before BlackD Proxy was updated ... If this BlackD Proxy update is the case, which disabled inbuilt 'ChaoticMoves' function then I'm even happier as I was earlier today! \o/<br />
<br />
That kicks ass! :D Happy botting to everyone! Cheers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are disabled, and yeah, that increases EXP/h and increases profit. It now follows monsters quicker and also doesn't walk over just killed bodies making it unwilling to loot them, so shouldn't miss bodies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">03-23-2012, 12:31</div></div><div class="posttext">@Malmis ... True, it worked so smoothly, too bad CipSoft decided to launch a patch again today due to that bugged outfit ...<br />
<br />
I'm laughing my ass off reading forums at the moment on tibia.com ... CipSoft screwed up the update and people are getting furious lol xD ... Well, I wanted to set up the bot and get working out later, it has been over an hour and a half now, I'll just let it go and wait till late afternoon :P. There will probably be a new version (9.46) afterall, so BlackD Proxy will have to be updated as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, have fun! :)</div></div><hr />
