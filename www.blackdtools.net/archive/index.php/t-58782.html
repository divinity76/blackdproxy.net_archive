Although I think it's not the case that it doesn't attack between waypoints, but it makes temporary waypoint to the starting position of a monster which it targeted and then it goes there ignoring eventual changes in position of the monster. Can't it be done with built in &quot;follow&quot; procedure in tibia?</div></div><hr />
