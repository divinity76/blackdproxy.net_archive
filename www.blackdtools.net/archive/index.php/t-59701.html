<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawk</div><div class="date">11-13-2012, 00:57</div></div><div class="posttext">how bout u just make ur bot non free and make it work flawless cus i know ur capable of that.. there are still ppl that would rather pay for this thing to use it properly than to bust their balls with it and be able to bot only low lvls..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Invicta</div><div class="date">11-13-2012, 12:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree 100%.. I have paid subscriptions to blackd for years... Great service.. I paid 5 days ago for TibiaIbot and still no access.. bad service.. I still continue to use blackd on my main account and have never been banned once.. Maybe because of my IP in ireland idk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">11-16-2012, 15:21</div></div><div class="posttext">well, I think it is legally safer to keep the bot free with optional donation system for VIP support. That is all.<br />
Anyways I always try to keep it free of bugs and I try to keep it as much undetectable as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways this thread was about a payed programming service for any kind of program. Even if it is not related with Tibia at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jesseh</div><div class="date">04-17-2015, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Daniel, do you have any info on a working healer for linux? I know very basic C, Lua and finding offsets for some games using Olly DBG but not enough to do a bot.<br />
<br />
I like to use blackd safe cheats healer when using windows, but I like to use linux too and can't play Tibia ideally there because of healing.<br />
<br />
It's possible to port it to linux? I saw some topics but didn't managed to study enough to do it (http://visualgdb.com/tutorials/porting/linux/). Do you think this task is too hard to acomplish? Probably I will have to change the offsets of the config, but dunno what else.<br />
<br />
I'm even willing to pay or donate to this task, could you or anyone on this forums help me?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!</div></div><hr />

Yes, it can be done through memory reads and virtual keys, adding some random timing to avoid detection. The hardest part is obtaining the correct memory addresses in the Linux client of Tibia, and also would have to make you a small autoupdater for such Linux addresses. I have few time nowadays and I would not accept this project for less than 1000 EUR. Maybe someone else can make it for you at a much cheaper price.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply. I understand that it would be hard/expensive to do it without time. I will read a bit more about it on tpforums too.</div></div><hr />
