<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">02-21-2011, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably they were just checking if the world was really only or not xD. Or some tests on data centers, IDK.<br />
CIP has no means to check each player one by one at the exact moment. As it was said on the discussing board, cip is handling with over 100,000 reports a week. I think it says all.</div></div><hr />

Would like some sort of confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mathew01</div><div class="date">02-21-2011, 23:35</div></div><div class="posttext">well the thread is getting pretty huge on neobot forums ive added myself lokana on my world and its loggin every 5 minuts for .1 sec</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">02-22-2011, 00:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess it might be true then. <br />
Just add conditional events to auto respond.<br />
And alerts.<br />
I guess no more 100% AFK bots, but he won't stop people from using bots and playing multiple accounts while watching a movie or so.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it seems by reading tibia boards that his is in fact true. Some people say that CM's do now have this power to investigate and ban botters just like old GM's. Soon a new department of CM's will be opened doing the old GM job, it will be headed up by Skyrr. On the other hand, people say that CM Skyrr is not a human but rather a Tibia Bot that logs every 5 minutes to do some banning, my guess on reported people.<br />
<br />
For now I guess we got to wait and see. <br />
Bot 100% AFK at your own risk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boom theres your answer<br />
<br />
<br />
As they have already done in the past, the responsible CipSoft members naturally collect data and make comparisons ingame within the context of developing our anti-cheating measures. If they come across botters in this process, they will not let them go unpunished, of course. This is nothing completely new, though. Obviously, it attracts more attention within the community at the moment which is good.<br />
<br />
Just a side note: CMs (= community managers) are not involved in rule enforcement.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
Mirade</div></div><hr />
