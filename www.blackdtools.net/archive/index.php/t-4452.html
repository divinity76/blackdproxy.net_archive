<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rafa</div><div class="date">06-20-2007, 02:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for being late to answer. <br />
<br />
My irl work. My tibian bussiness, do not allowed me to do it before, I know im late.<br />
<br />
Basicly. If your mana runs out you will get an alarm and a red BD message saying : NOT ENOUGHT MANA TO CAST EXORI VIS. So your UHS will start to heal you in order to save you.<br />
<br />
So get uhs allways with you in case you are sleeping and your manas run out,  you will get woke by your 创mana out创 or no more uhs to heal alarm.<br />
<br />
Not needed to be at 80% , you can set it at 70% , the auto heal , and then set 70% on cavebot, else you will keep casting exori vis till creature is alive or your hp is over 70% , at 70% now with the fixed version, u will stip vising, and healing at 70% (for example) . <br />
<br />
The thing is, if your level is low, 80 or less for drags, set 80% healing, as the drags will force u to heal below 80 % but it will never be 80, will be some lower, as they hit a bit hard for your level, so in order to dont waste uhs, is prefery to waste 40 mana , than a uh, that costs way more.<br />
<br />
P.S.: Botting BD sorcs, dont worry about update, people will lousily complain, we will get some dmgs back and anyways, we are still the voc with fastest and cheapest way to get 200-300. Just by stamina laws, we owns.<br />
<br />
Never loose the faith, BlackD cares. And if anything shall be improved, we will do it. Sorcs ftw :p <br />
<br />
On any case, start a knight , u can get 50 on a week with medium eq no skill :P</div></div><hr />
