<br />
It also worries me sometimes because I'm not sure what all sends packets, but when the waypoints and targetting are in conflict it makes me wonder.<br />
<br />
edit: my exp just dropped by 15k exp/hr because of it.</div></div><hr />

I've found making scripts with waypoints acting as &quot;mapclicks&quot; (1 screen or less apart) can help limit the amout of time you spend running around the creature aimlessly. Also I use follow and auto rechase in client.</div></div><hr />
