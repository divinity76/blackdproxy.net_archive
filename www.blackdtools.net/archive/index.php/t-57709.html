<br />
Open Conditionals:<br />
<br />
On Condition: thing1: put $mymana$, on operator put #number&gt;=#, on thing2: put 60, on Delay action time(ms) put 60000, I normally put 12000 on non-dangerous monsters.<br />
<br />
And finally on action write down utura.<br />
<br />
<br />
What this does it will check every 300-to-700 ms if your mana is more than 60. If it does it will say utura, if not, then nothing.<br />
<br />
It slows down the overall bot, because it constantly checks for the conditional, and it normally cannot make utura, as it has the cooldown. So the rest of time it's making puff clouds, but nevertheless I find it extremely useful when hunting for profit.<br />
<br />
So again: this is how it should look:<br />
<br />
thing1               operator             thing2          delay           action<br />
$mymana$         #number&gt;=#        60             60000           utura</div></div><hr />
