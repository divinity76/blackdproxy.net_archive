<br />
Im thinking how I can test this with maybe a free account, Im wondering is this risky running a conditional status check?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the fast reply,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-29-2012, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I tried to ask Daniel about the checking status risky/or not and he said treat everything with caution and use at your own risk. At this point in time I dont NEED this script, but If I were to bot Hydras or something of the matter that Paralyzes like crazy this would be fucking GOLD. If Malmis or any other scripter would like to input on checking $statusbit:n$ I would love some input, I know Malmis had a mounting script that checked status back in the day, so any form of help is appreciated thanks guys.<br />
