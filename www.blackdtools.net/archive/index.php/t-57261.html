You should be aware of this important fact: 
They delete accounts with same registered street than bot accounts 
 
Why I know that? One of my friends was deleted on all the accounts that he had registered to street address &quot;Something, 40&quot; even without botting at all - just because another person botted with an account registered to street &quot;Something, 40&quot; 
 
Note 1: All the accounts registered to street &quot;Something, 41&quot; were not deleted by the automatic detection system. 
Note 2: &quot;Something," />

You should be aware of this important fact:<br />
They delete accounts with same registered street than bot accounts<br />
<br />
Why I know that? One of my friends was deleted on all the accounts that he had registered to street address &quot;Something, 40&quot; even without botting at all - just because another person botted with an account registered to street &quot;Something, 40&quot;<br />
<br />
Note 1: All the accounts registered to street &quot;Something, 41&quot; were not deleted by the automatic detection system.<br />
Note 2: &quot;Something, 40&quot; and &quot;Something, 41&quot; are only used as examples here. They were not the real names/numbers in this case. That exact information will be kept secret because privacy.<br />
<br />
This report is 100% reliable, and for me it is a solid proof that the automatic detection system can be unfair in some cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The auto detection system has been banning more innocents than botters I do believe, my RL got banhammered without botting about a year ago I lol'd so hard since I was botting 24/7 at the time and survived</div></div><hr />

if it's worth the effort, ofc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razoor</div><div class="date">02-07-2012, 23:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Well me and a friend often have accounts registerd on the same address as eachother but none of us ever got banned cuz the other one was, and also theres only been one acc banned :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delejon</div><div class="date">02-08-2012, 12:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a stupid method, although CipSoft are kind of stupid.<br />
<br />
Edit: After thinking a bit I don't believe this is how it works. I have 2 brothers who play Tibia fair and square, we all live in the same house and are registered in the same adress. How can they be deleted just because I am using a bot? They have had no interference with any bot. I'll however post weather this theory is right or wrong by the next banwave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-08-2012, 14:29</div></div><div class="posttext">if you copy all the registration info of your enemy and then you use some detectable things then your enemy will be probably deleted. <br />
I think it might be an easy way to delete your enemies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is mainly the reason why I don't think it works like this. It's exploited too easily.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-09-2012, 11:04</div></div><div class="posttext">If you know enough your enemy (name/surname/country/city/street) then I am 99% sure that it will work - if you register exactly the same information - . I have not tested it myself but it would be worth a try if you have &quot;well known&quot; enemies.<br />
<br />
Note: this is done through an automatic system that compare strings. A simple space more or less = no match. A small difference in the way you write the street = no match. For example: &quot;Street Something 40&quot; and &quot;St. Something 40&quot; = no match. I think that would be the only problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well maybe that's why CipSoft think it won't be exploited, it will be difficult to get the whole string to match your enemies'.</div></div><hr />

I should insist: Never use same registration info in 2 accounts!</div></div><hr />

Something new you learn everyday visiting &quot;old&quot; forums. All my projects ended around the time detections started.</div></div><hr />
