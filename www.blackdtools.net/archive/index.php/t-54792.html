This one shows your game play window with the maximum space of the widgets. As you can see, if you open too many things, you wont be able to see your character.<br />

Could you post or PM me the URL of the client swf? :)<br />
<br />
You should be able to find the URL by viewing the source of the page when you are playing Tibia. For instance in Chrome, you just press Ctrl + U or click on the wrench and go to Tools -&gt; View Source and then search for &quot;.swf&quot; (without quotes). Similar for Firefox.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 <br />
And well, about the bot: When the new client comes of course Blackd Proxy will stop working for real Tibia. All existing bots will stop working too. However I will be able to update Blackd Safe Cheats really fast. It can be easily modified to work with the new web client. Then I will have the only working bot again. And then I will work on a new cavebot based on that web client. A web won't be able to detect cavebot, so I will be able to grant safety again! Working on a cavebot based on current client is like wasting time. I can't grant safety and it is not a great business because at this moment there are lots of bots in the market.<br />

<br />
This example isn't very good because you'll have to zoom the picture. Anyway, what you can see is the icon being moved from my backpack to the ground. For now one, and by default, if try to move a stake of items, you will not have to confirm the &quot;Moving Menu&quot;. By default, it moves all items in a row.<br />
Also there is a display of the so claimed HUD display. Useless and ungle, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
http://img855.imageshack.us/i/99678604.jpg/<br />
<br />
<br />
This picture shows the &quot;Moving menu&quot; To make it appear, from now one and even if its a stake of items, you must press control. Otherwise, it will drag the pile. Check the super cool menu. It's pretty :)<br />

Read the quote from rap and i can't see anywhere him stating that he might do it. just that its simple to modify safe cheats and bot would be safe.</div></div><hr />

What's that to LOL about? You can't notice any difference over 60fps in Tibia anyway. And that's prolly a limit set by Cip. Fps over 100 is just waste of performance.</div></div><hr />

Its web Browser based. You enter on the website, you enter your account and you'll be on your page. There, where you have your characters, you'll see 2 buttons: 1 to &quot;Edit&quot; and another to &quot;Play&quot;.<br />
<br />
@Tony32<br />
<br />
I just lol'ed at the difference. Nothing more.<br />
I usually play with 70 frames on normal client.<br />
Anyway, it's a huge difference.</div></div><hr />
