I've already read about &quot;blackd is safe because i didn't get banned in the last 2 massbans&quot; but i just want to be sure (i don't want to loose my char).<br />

I want to train on a summoned monk with my knight.<br />

So here's what functions i need:<br />
<br />
On sorc:<br />
-autoidle<br />
<br />
On knight:<br />
-eat food<br />
-cast exura ico when full mana<br />
-fishing<br />
-autoidle (i think it won't be needed, as there will be fishing and casting)<br />
<br />
These 2 chars will be ran on one PC, so i am using BlackD MC.<br />
<br />
Are these functions safe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
so use blackd safe on your knight to eat food/use spells<br />
<br />
Use BlackD Proxy on sorc (you dnt care about?) using fishing<br />
<br />
Make sure you don't activate proxy on client you will login Knight</div></div><hr />

So you say that every function is not safe? Even simple fishing, eating and casting?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm quite sure that it is the connection through the proxy that is unsafe. I've seen people complain of bans just after logging in with no features running but proxy open.</div></div><hr />
