<br />
We cannot guarantee 100% safety from the automatic system, but for slave characters it is fine to use.<br />
<br />
Check tutorials to see if you can understand how to use it. It is easy, if you can read... (most people can't)<br />
<br />
Anyway support/questions sections are answered frequently if you have any problems,</div></div><hr />
