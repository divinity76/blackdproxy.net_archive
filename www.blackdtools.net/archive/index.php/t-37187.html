He also works out of his house and his job is very important. Everyday the man must sleep with the lights on to avert from tradgedy. One night the man gets so sick of the light he turns it out for the night. The next moring he reads the newspaper, takes out a gun, and shoots himself.<br />
<br />
He works at light house and the light he turned off was the beacon. A ship collided with the rocks and many died.  <br />
<br />
&quot;The man did not want to go home beacuse the man with the mask was there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course this is totally off topic.</div></div><hr />
