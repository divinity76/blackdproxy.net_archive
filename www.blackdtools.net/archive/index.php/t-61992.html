	<meta name="description" content="Hi, I was wondering if there is any version that is capable with running with 7.4. I'm currently playing classicus and am hoping to find a bot with auto runemaking and auto logout when someone appears on screen/or on battle list. 
 
Also am hoping for a compatible bot that has basic cavebot features for hunting rotworms etc. 
 
If nothing like this is available I understand as 7.4 is quite an old version. 
 
All help would be appreciated, I've been researching for 4-5 hours so far no luck.
