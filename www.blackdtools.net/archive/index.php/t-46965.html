Clear my mind up.:eek:<br />
<br />
Well I used to bot. Deletion warning and such. And I just hide my name cause I don't like random people messaging me. I would bot but don't want ban :(<br />
<br />
Anyway going kind of slow right now all my spots are taken. Doing Shattered Isles quests and Ice Islands quest now. So I will take some exp at Bone beast isle/gs isle or even helheim. I'm trying to get the assassin addon before level 80(looting it, not buying). I'll post a screenshot later if I feel like it :S</div></div><hr />
