The new installer was built with Inno Setup 5, a great free installer maker. It should work perfectly in Windows Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Well, here are the newest changes in Blackd Proxy 22.3:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackd Proxy 22.3<br />
----------------------------<br />
 - Blackd Proxy now avoid doing unnecessary closes of Tibia clients at Tibia.dat updates.<br />
 - It now allows you to keep some config values unmodified through updates if you store them in configxxx\config.override.ini or settings.override.ini<br />
 - It now avoids tutorial hints popups.<br />
 - Fixed a DirectX problem in Windows Vista/Windows 7<br />
 - Fixed a bug with private messages<br />
<br />
<br />
and last hour update:<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackd Proxy 22.4<br />
----------------------------<br />
 - Blackd Proxy will keep executing even if it is unable to read Tibia.dat from Tibia folder. Anyways it still will give a safety warning in that case.</div></div><hr />

But I got a problem lol &gt;.&lt; ... Aynway, I've uninstalled Blackd Proxy 22.2, downloaded new installer for BlackD Proxy 22.3, installed it, opened it and then boom!:<br />

I was like 'what the hell?!' ... Tibia is being installed on C: drive under Program Files, of course it's latest version with latest .dat file ... So ok, I've uninstalled Tibia as well, completely deleted all Tibia related files, even in hidden AppData folder where Tibia maps are located and such. Downloaded latest version of tibia, installed it and that didnt help at all either. I mean, path to Tibia folder is correct, no doubt about that, .dat file is the right one, no doubt about that either, what else is left there for me to do to be able to use BlackD Proxy once again? I'm not sure, maybe there's a sticky thread explaining this problem, I didn't check that I admit. :&lt;</div></div><hr />

Great that you can save configs now. :p Hopefully won't crash when opening a private chat channel too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-08-2012, 00:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I have fixed the tibia.dat problem in 22.4, or at least it should try to keep running in that case + it will display extra debug data that might help me to fix it 100% .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yazoo</div><div class="date">03-08-2012, 01:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Daniel you have probably  answered this lots of times but regarding the bot being detectable do you believe that it is mainly the cavebot functions that lead to detection? i would like to use it for simple scripts and like click hold for when i use runes etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">03-08-2012, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool even though I do not use it.<br />
So, now it is turn for healing slots in BSC and maybe some other from proposals? Ofc if you find free time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">03-08-2012, 11:50</div></div><div class="posttext">You sir are amazing! :P Well, let me explain what happened a time ago ... I couldn't watch tibiacast broadcasts and I was like 'wtf' so I posted on their forum, quite a while a back and their admin/developer/whatever said I should clear whatever it's inside Tibia folder in '%LOCALAPPDATA%\VirtualStore\' because I'm using Vista. That worked, basically because there was outdated .dat file in that folder and tibiacast couldn't seem to read the right one properly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I thought this would help as well with solving this problem with BLackD Proxy so I've cleaned/deleted that .dat file as well, but it didn't help. ... I thought I'd let you know about every possibility I tried out.<br />
<br />
With BlackD Proxy version 22.4 all seems back to normal. \o/ Fast help by you Daniel and we're back on track ... at least me. xD<br />
<br />
But I seriously still don't know what's going on with that .dat file that's casuing so much problems, meh &gt;.&gt;.</div></div><hr />

Your case is very interesting for me.<br />
Does it work 100% for you in 22.4? Do you still get a warning about the tibia.dat problem? If you still get the warning then please post screenshot of the new warning message, or even better: send it to me by email to daniel@blackdtools.com <br />
I want to fix all weird problems in windows vista/7 but I don't really know what is the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">03-08-2012, 14:51</div></div><div class="posttext">@BlackD ... No, it works absolutely perfectly, 22.4 seems to fix the problem for good! I've installed 22.4, botting for 2 hours now, no error whatsoever. If anything happens I'll be sending you an email in the future, but I think you already did a great job in version 22.4 cuz like I said it works perfectly. I mean ... If there's someone else using Vista/7 out there, post here.<br />
<br />
BlackD Proxy version 22.4 + OS Vista = working great.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help again, that was fast! :)</div></div><hr />

Blackd Proxy should not close without warning or error. I can try to fix it if you send me the screenshot of that error, and the file errors.txt of your blackd proxy folder.<br />
my email: daniel@blackdtools.com &lt;- send the screenshot and errors.txt here</div></div><hr />

You can try doing this:<br />
- uninstall previous installation of Blackd Proxy<br />
- delete previous folder of blackd proxy<br />
- reinstall executing the installer as admin</div></div><hr />

Probarly just the new installer may have some signatures matching malware.</div></div><hr />

I have to disable it for like a minute everytime I launch BlackD Proxy ... An extra few clicks, but after that I'm boooooooooooootttting all the way. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-22-2012, 15:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, some antiviruses give false positives &quot;generic virus&quot; only because my software uses memory edition functions.<br />
Disabling the antivirus during the installation usually fix the problem in this kind of cases.<br />
<br />
And for paranoic persons: you can check the code yourself, installation script is included. And Inno Setup is free. You can download it and build the installer yourself.</div></div><hr />
