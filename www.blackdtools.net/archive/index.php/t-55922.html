can read more about it there... and btw they cannot guarantee they are 100% safe, just from a technical point of view, its hard to detect..<br />
<br />
cipsoft bot check<br />
u got full hp<br />
send for 0.2 seconds that you have 10 hp<br />
in 210 ms, you will have full hp again.<br />
if you noticed in 0.2 seconds and healed, your probably using auto UH.</div></div><hr />

Tugbot++) is still in beta stage and offers a small variety of features (basic things like healer, hud, etc) and hasnt been updated for it to work on the newest client. one thing thats for sure, the GUI is fucking awesome. u gotta pay 10 bucks to gain access to this bot.</div></div><hr />
