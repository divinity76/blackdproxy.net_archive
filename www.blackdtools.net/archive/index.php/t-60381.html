	<meta name="description" content="Hello. 
 
I was wondering if I could get BSC working on the preview servers. 
Tried to run it as it is but it does not work so I thought it might be because the preview clients are located in different folder. 
So, if I would install it over there, it should work properly, right? 
Anyone has tried this? 
Would it be still safe? 
 
 
Yours," />
