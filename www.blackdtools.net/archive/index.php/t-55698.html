It seemed that almost every screenshot was taken right after relogging to another char. 
 
My proxy log shows this, and I believe this is the cause of the bug: 
 
#gameserver1 closed (disconnected by user logout)# 
(Giving alarm because client 1 was closed) 
(disabling the alarm because it was a desired logout)" />

Also, I think it only happens when relogging between different chars (ctrl+g).</div></div><hr />
