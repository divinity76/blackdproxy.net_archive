<br />
You restart in safe mode edit your msconfig to stop it on start up then you restart in normal mode and fallow the file dir in msconfig to delete the virus<br />
<br />
Not that hard at all<br />
<br />
I dont even use an AV/firewall/or anti spyware and i dont get viruses even when downloading shit lol<br />
<br />
If anyone has a copy of the security tool send it to me so i can put it on a VM and make a video of how to fix it</div></div><hr />
