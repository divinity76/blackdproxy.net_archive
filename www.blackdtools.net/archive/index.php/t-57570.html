<br />
yes, it is safe. Nobody reported a ban because that. Anyways it will be even more safer (and fixed) in the next update. I will add stronger time randomization to the antilogout &quot;dance&quot;, just in case.<br />
<br />
Btw, the main problem is Cipsoft changed the logout message so bot can't detect it right now.<br />
<br />
Old message: You have been idle for 15 minutes. You will be disconnected in one minute if you are still idle then.<br />
<br />
New message: There was no variation in your behaviour for 15 minutes. You will be disconnected in one minute if there is no change in your actions until then.<br />
<br />
blackd proxy 22.7 will consider this fact and will also allow you to customize that server logout message for correct detection of the autologout event in ot servers. Anyways -by default- all older tibia versions will be loaded with older logout message, and all newest tibia versions will be loaded with new logout message.<br />
<br />
I still need to do some tests. I will upload 22.7 after that.</div></div><hr />

It fixes and improves the autodance feature of the Trainer. The dance is absolutely random in time and movement so it should not be detectable.<br />
The cavebot is still detectable, but you should be safe if you don't use that feature of Blackd Proxy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still not a guaranteed ban though is it!? What's the chances of getting banned by this auto detection?</div></div><hr />
