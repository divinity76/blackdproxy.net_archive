You have a few options, loot bag items or just go for the gold. and another question is are you doing it manual or botting?  If you are doing it manual I would suggest orc fort, in 1 hour you should have about 10 - 12k from halberds, and roughly 3- 5k pure gold + atleast 10 - 20 orc teeth which are worth 150 gp each to npc in thais. and at your skill level and character level should be no problem at all with decent eq. If you are botting I would suggest Shadowthorn, the firestarters drop decent gold, Heaven Blossoms and elvish bows + you have the elf archanists which drop holy orchids which are always in demand, and would be very easy for your character to bot. Just a couple suggestions, I have more if you would like.</div></div><hr />
