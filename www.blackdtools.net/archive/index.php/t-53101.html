Given the advances in HTML5, and PHP web-sockets, I've been able to find a way to communicate a web browser with the server without the need of making a request to the server every 10ms (like some people try to do it using AJAX) and thus I've been able to create a little Tibia.

<br />
I am making this thread to ask you people for your opinions of what made Tibia decline? (if that's what you think), what do you miss from Tibia?, what features would you remove from Tibia?, what would you add/bring back? and any other comment or suggestion..<br />
<br />
I am trying to make the best decisions and think the best for the game. As development comes along I could give you guys some screenshots or previews. <br />

Thanks!<br />

The biggest mistake, by far, they did was doing half-assed &quot;solutions&quot; to prevent cheaters, which only ended up hurting legit players</div></div><hr />

<br />
For now my game is not open for testers or the public.<br />
<br />
By the aimbot you mean the runes just shooting the player without need to drag mouse to where you to shoot it (aim in other words ahaha)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback!</div></div><hr />

All that elemental damage crap, the &quot;vocation balancing&quot;.... I mean. 100 pure levels give about 20 spell dmg. That is lol.<br />
Also aimbot thingy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">11-01-2010, 16:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck.. but i can tell you this.. making this will put you doing it either in years or constantly making it.. it took them 3-5 years(sorry for the numbers can't remember) with great developers to get to the 7.1 version..<br />
<br />
And you alone?<br />
Take a lot of time. But using HTML5 and php.. fascinating i can tell you that.<br />
<br />
THUMBS UP!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Hotkeys are bullshit! Remember pushing people around to make them not heal? Or having to aim a square ahead to land an Sd?<br />
I remember everyone from Trimera quitting after the Hotkey update because everyone and their mother can hit &quot;f5&quot; for an Sd. Wars were 100% more legit</div></div><hr />
