	<meta name="description" content="Tibiacash.pl is run'd by gallar, old scammer on this forum.. The site was reported to me after some dude from this forum was scammed buying gold from them, then when i checked it our they sponsored a site called &quot;Gallar.org&quot; so i got in contact with the site owner who denied that he was gallar, but today he signed on to messenger using a pic of gallar as profile pic.  
 
Off topic: I'm pretty much retired from the forum so stop sending 50 pms becuse i didn't respond on the first one." />
