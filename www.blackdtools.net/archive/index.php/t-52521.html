 <br />
Our targets: Honest persons. Good persons. Helpfull persons. Polite persons.<br />

We need persons that put some light and justice in the forum from time to time. That is all. You don't need to be here all the day. Connect once each 3 months and take a look around. Delete some spam and ban some scammers. That is all. Of course if you visit the forum more often then that is better for us, but in any case you should not consider this a job. <br />
 <br />
For the ones that finally get selected as moderator, I offer:<br />
- Power to delete posts, power to ban users and access to moderators forum.<br />
- A big reputation increase toward this community and probably toward the whole Tibia community.<br />
- A lifetime license for my software.<br />
- My full respect. Your word will be always above the word of other users.</div></div><hr />

I have been around here since 2007, I'm maybe not so active in the whole forum, but I have been active in the trade section, done alot of trades the past years here and I guess most people that know me would say I am a Honest, Polite and a Good person.<br />
<br />
I have been around tibia since early 2003, played on a lot of worlds on and off since then, so I know alot about the game!<br />
Right now, I login at least once a day to check on my Trading threads, so I'd say I am pretty active on the forum.<br />
Well, I dont really know what more to say.. I'd LOVE to join your crew and help you guys with the forum!<br />
<br />
Thanks, Yamal -</div></div><hr />

I'm already over 2 years on this forum. I'm often visiting general&amp;trade&amp;other boards - done some deals and hadn't any problems yet. I can say I'm honest and quite good person - I would seek forum from bad people. I know english very well what means it would be easy to communicate with me. In free time I could help people. I am also experienced tibia player, so it's nothing new to me.<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Keno</div></div><hr />

I guess i klick at that button 10x times each day xD<br />
Ive done some trades here, not that active in dealing anymore, or posting so nowdays i mostly look around.<br />
Me and my teachers at school would describe me as a nice person that always laughs ;D<br />
annnnd thats all i guess ;&gt;</div></div><hr />

Nowadays I keep updating the legendary thread with funny pics because I think that's what brings people together.<br />
I know Satanás, I think he can say a few words about me.<br />
Also I visit this forum because I love it's comunity. As you can see, most people posting here have been visiting for 2 years or more.<br />
I don't have that experience in trading, and no interest in doing it because I think Tibia itself is not worth all that people do, but I can say I have real interest in being helpful in case I become a mod, so I'd have to learn and help at trading with a smile. ^^<br />
And a little message to blackd:<br />
You offer interesting things, but being a mod is not chasing those things. I think being a mod is being respectful, helpful and truthful.<br />
Respect and reputation comes after you give yourself, not only here, but in life.<br />
<br />
Idk, I could type a lot of things but my message has been given, I think.<br />
^.^</div></div><hr />

I am interested in this position, I am always actively checking the forums and reporting any spams or rule violations in order to keep a nice community and I would be pleased to help it keep going.

 <br />
Hmm, I see. But if you're not looking for someone who is here allday long, how can you require experience in trading? Just following what blackd himself said in the first post.<br />
And afterall, this is a thing who can be easily learnt.<br />
I must agree with you that it has become only a trading board, but we need to change this, all of us, not only the mods.<br />
This forum was and still being a great one, it's up to us to make it even better.</div></div><hr />

I guess I've been around for 3 years. And I know the majority of the active community.<br />
<br />
I think I'm one of the only few who still check BlackDproxy questions/supports and try and help out.<br />
<br />
I find myself starring at blackd forums at least 5 times a day.. Even checking trade boards when I've never traded with anyone here. (bordem)<br />
<br />
The current problem with the forums I think is all the hacklinks/spam on older parts of the forums, such as the BlackD proxy part. And as I check these parts I think I'd actually help.<br />
<br />
Oh one last note. I still use BlackD proxy... Not many of our forum members (and even moderators) do anymore.</div></div><hr />

I've got some good programing skills, not great but good. I've spoken with blackd by emails and help him with some improvements or SUGGESTION to improvements to blackd.

Hello, I'm here for a long time.<br />
My name is Paul and I'm 18<br />
I may not have too many posts here lately dwelt more and more time.<br />
Browse the sections that interest me - trade.<br />
As you already know I'm Polish and I think we could use someone who knows the language of the forum, I have extensive experience in moderating. For over two years I was a moderator on the Polish site forum.wiaderko.com - this is compared to that forum and I would give myself a huge trick, certainly in the role that you just admitted it. I like new challenges and I want to meet new people. I hope that appreciate my application positively.<br />
Regards, Paul<br />
<br />
I spend an awful lot of time at the computer, because I work at home on it. I think it would help a lot</div></div><hr />

I know how to code themes, modifications and the works. I am a moderator on the biggest OpenTibia site, OTFans.net. <br />
<br />
Even though I'm not really an &quot;old&quot; member, I sure do have experience in the moderation field. I'd love to help you out here and I'm capable of being online everyday or at least every second day.<br />
<br />
My application in a summary:<br />
<br />
 Fluent in vBulletin software<br />
 Fluent in the English language<br />
 Experienced tibia player<br />
 Traded many accounts and gold over my career, experienced in trading<br />
 Moderator on biggest OT site, OTFans.net<br />

<br />
I've been using these forums for a long time and I must say, with some sadness on these words, that this forum is dead for a couple of months. Massive threads related with spam come everyday and, each time I open this forum, I feel really mad seeing that no one is doing what they are supposed to.<br />
Well, I'm a student and I spend lots of time in from of the computer doing lots of works with heavy softwares (MathLab, Autocad, Visual Studio, ...). I always get bored after a couple of hours of work and to distract myself I open Blackd tools website and read some of the most interesting and funny active threads. What do I want to say is that I have time and responsibility enough to handle and manage these forums, make them a better place to all. I've always been and always will be a honest and trustful person. No matter the circumstance i know how to not choose sides and be neutral.<br />
You might think that I only want to become moderator due to the benefit of a full life time software (Who doesn't? hehe) but, if i ever become a moderator, I'm going to reject it. I do not have second intentions with the fact of being moderator. Just making this forum better and more competitive among the other's companies. <br />
I truly hope that my proposal be considered and accepted.<br />
<br />
More about me:<br />
I'm Portuguese and i live in Lisbon. Love to play football and basketball. When i have nothing to do, guess what, i play tibia xD. The best game i've ever found.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
Hurriel</div></div><hr />

Can't remember, it's been a long time. Nowadays I'm not that active anymore, since I quit Tibia long ago. But I still visit this forum about once a day at least, to check the new posts and reading through the very long threads (like the one with 100+pages of funny pictures xD).<br />
<br />
I guess I would not apply for a mod if this was a year ago, but I feel this might be a good time now. Since I barely have any relations with anyone on this forum, it would be easier to make fair decisions. And deleting spam ain't that hard ;&gt;<br />
<br />
Also, during schooltime - when I'm bored at most I tend to visit this forum once every 10 minutes.<br />
Posting from WORK atm ;&lt;<br />
