Did you insulted a CM or a god? :eek:<br />

And the 2 offensive statements weren't anything serious, one was for saying .i. and then the other was for saying suck my trallalaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  None were to a God or GM, just to a regular person</div></div><hr />

I would write a letter to Cipsoft offices if I were you.<br />

<br />
Dear Tibia player,<br />
<br />
&gt; My account for Atalek was reported for a offensive statement and is now scheduled<br />
&gt; for deletion because of having a prior final warning. Is there any why to not have<br />
&gt; this happen.  I didn't know I could get deleted for offensive statements, I<br />
&gt; thought it could only be for illegal software use.  If you could please give me<br />
&gt; another chance I will not make anymore offensive statements.<br />
&gt; Thanks,<br />
&gt; Ben<br />
<br />
Thank you for your request.<br />
<br />
Your account has been punished for making an offensive statement, which is a<br />
violation of the Tibia Rules.<br />
<br />
The punishment of the account has been based on a statement which has been<br />
transmitted directly to us from the game server. So there is no way to change or<br />
fake it. For this reason, statements are considered to be valid proof.<br />
<br />
Here is the chat log which has led to the punishment of your account:<br />
<br />
Private Message 19.05.2012, 09:33:18    Atalek  fuck u<br />
<br />
Before downloading the client you were asked to read and agree to the Tibia Rules.<br />
Claiming that &quot;you did not know the rules&quot; is not a valid excuse for breaking them<br />
and will not spare you the punishment. Remember to never agree to something which<br />
you have not read and understood fully.<br />
<br />
The punishment was justified and will remain.<br />
<br />
We are sorry to hear that your account will be deleted but please keep in mind<br />
that you already had a Final Waning on it.<br />
<br />
The Tibia Rules can be found here<br />

Dear CipSoft,<br />
<br />
     Being a loyal customer who has spent over $300 dollars on premium accounts for this character, and spent over 3 years of my time playing I don't see deletion of the account as a justifiable punishment.  It says in your tibia rules that in severe cases the account can be punished. The rule I broke and how it was broken does not seem close to a severe case.  Along with this under your rules about insulting statements, it states to refrain from insulting anyone.  I don't see my statement as a insult, &quot;Fuck off&quot;  in my country and I'm assuming in other countrys means, &quot;Go away!!!!!!!!!!! AND LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!&quot;.  Which is not a insult at all.  It does not state anywhere where using the F word is against the rules.  I think on your part it is a unfair, excessive punishment, along with bad business to delete someone for such a small act.  Please reconsider your punishment.<br />
Thanks, <br />
Atalek</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hint: try to send Cipsoft a paper letter (you know: like the old times) I am sure that at least they will pay more attention to it.</div></div><hr />

mind keeping this thread up to date with what they answered to that ? i'm pretty interested haah</div></div><hr />

seems that they just fucked you up for being high level since none of my 50-150 lvls has ever been banished or deleted for this crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dying2liv</div><div class="date">05-29-2012, 20:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your request.<br />
<br />
After thoroughly checking your case again, we are still convinced that the<br />
punishment was justified. The Tibia Rules have been violated too often with your<br />
characters. For this reason the account will be deleted and cannot be returned to<br />
you.<br />
<br />
You have violated Tibia rule 2a several times, which is why a relatively minor<br />
insult was punished with a banishment. As your account was on a final warning<br />
already, the banishment then triggered the deletion. I am sorry, but the two<br />
notations for offensive statements should have been a warning to you.<br />
<br />
If you want to continue playing, you will have to create a new account. To avoid<br />
punishments on a possible new account, please read and follow the Tibia Rules at<br />
 http://www.tibia.com/support/?subtopic=tibiarules<br />
<br />
Please understand that our decision is final and that we cannot answer any further<br />
emails in this matter.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

<br />
I am afraid they have a macro/bot to answer email complains so don't expect much help from them if you only send emails. Your email will be one more of the thousands of emails they have to reply and in that case I don't think they will take a look on your specific case / char level.</div></div><hr />
