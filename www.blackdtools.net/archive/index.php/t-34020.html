DO NOT TOUCH THE EQ/BACKPACK OF YOUR CHARACTER UNTIL IT HAS BOUGHT EQ!<br />
<br />
This script's also for free accounts!<br />
<br />
What it does:<br />
- Does tutorial<br />
- Hunts for food and sells it, until it has enough money for equipment<br />
- Buys decent eq<br />
- Goes to Aldee rats (Free account version) or Premium rats (Premium account version)<br />
- Deposits money and logs out some exp before lvl 9.<br />
<br />
I've also uploaded a script which goes straight to rook temple and so skipping the tutorial. Just start the script after you logged in.<br />
<br />
Only use the premium script on a premium account!<br />
<br />
Versions<br />
<br />
 V1.0<br />
 V1.1 - Removed the part where it went to bugs at a specific level. It's too dangerous.<br />
 V2.0 - It will buy a backpack from now on. Also some other small improvements. Also uploaded the premium account version of the script!<br />
 V2.1 - Fixed the cockroach part. Also disabled the messages you get from the bot to avoid banishments.<br />
 V2.2 - Fixed the tranch part, and deleted waypoints in the cockroachcave. You won't be stuck there anymore. Note that you're character will keep killing cockroaches until there aren't any at your screen. I can't solve this.<br />
<br />
<br />
UNCHECK ALLOW REPOSITION AT START!<br />
<br />
I used small parts of Darky's script for this but redone &amp; improved parts myself too. This script is fully working on tibia 8.4!<br />

It should sell food if you're cap goes under 20. Note that it will only go to shop at certain points, so let it run for like 5 more minutes and it should go to shop. :)</div></div><hr />

Didn't happen to me.. Tested it with 6 characters now. The only 'bug' is that it might not stop killing cockroaches right after it killed 3, but that's not a big problem.</div></div><hr />

When you deposit 1000 gold on rook bank, you can't deposit more money so, it's a waste of time when you have that gold and your character is comming back an try to deposit another and another time, there's a way to check, if the npc say this message:<br />
<br />
09:42 Paulie: You have certainly made a pretty penny. Your account balance is 1000 gold. That also means that the limit of your junior bankaccount is exceeded - to deposit more money, you have to go to mainland.<br />
<br />
the character doesn't come again to the bank, he just keep hunting until get the exp.<br />
<br />
by the way, other question, i do something wrong? my character has to buy backpack? because i didn't see it &gt;.&lt; if you don't put that, i think it would be nice to get backpack, because when you get your max balance o rook, on backpack you can store 2k on pure money =) <br />

No need to buy a backpack because u can take out from rook only 1k ^^, no need to deposit more money</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well it will go to bank if the character has collected more than 900 gold. So it will deposit 900 gold (which is below the limit of 1000 gold) and will then start hunting again with a fresh backpack. This way you might be able to collect more gold :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will test this. I was huntung on your old script with bag not backpack, we will se ;)<br />
<br />
U can modify part when char goes to cocroaches?, Char try too kill all monsters and when he find ladder, and no monster at screen, then goes up. U can make &quot;if char have more than 5 corocaches legs, leave monster and go up&quot; if this possible. I think its possible with Black Proxy :)<br />
<br />
Anyway great job with this script, my comp turn on all days and nights, and i make new acc on my world and use your script i have at day and at night 4k extra in my acc balance, on my main char ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
U can modify part when char goes to cocroaches?, Char try too kill all monsters and when he find ladder, and no monster at screen, then goes up. U can make &quot;if char have more than 5 corocaches legs, leave monster and go up&quot; if this possible. I think its possible with Black Proxy :)<br />

That's what I did :P Problem is blackD won't go to the next line (which is: stop killing when you collected 4) when there are still cockroaches on the screen.<br />
<br />
But it's not rly a big problem :P It might waste max 5 minutes :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use this script all the time in version 1,1 and now 2,0 and i have no problems.<br />
 <br />
The only thing i noticed is when char finish hunting at rabits and deers goes to bank deposit all, then going to buy bp, then go to shop leave shovel on floor, going to bank withdraw 15gp, going buy shield, then leave rope, going to bank withdraw all and go buy sabre, legs, armor and helmet (or something like that ;P). Char can make this things at one time and dont go to bank 2 or 3 times. <br />
<br />
And when he have above 900 gp in bank and above 900 gp in bp he goes to bank 2 or 3 times at lvl 8, and when char have 10% to lvl 9 logout ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway this is not big problem when i sleep ^^.</div></div><hr />

That's the problem... You don't do the tutorial, you make the bot do it for you. Now its going to bug.</div></div><hr />

Yep, like Dach said, you should ONLY start the script at the begin of the tutorial, so the first time you log in. Otherwise it won't work.</div></div><hr />

At first, it doesnt go to get armor <br />
2. it doesnt talk properly with npc (i think now you have to wait for answer.)<br />
3. doesnt kill cocroaches properly<br />
4. doesnt follow NPC with meat properly...<br />
sux when you have to run 12 mcs at once, and every stucks... :mad:<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and what's the most retarded thing ever, it changes your outfit to yelow&amp;orange mage, everytime the same way.<br />
It's like shouting &quot;HEY IM BOTTER BAN ME PLEASE!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">idkmn</div><div class="date">08-23-2009, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">I tested it and the script only had some problems at the begin.<br />
I used the &quot;Rook to main by Arne V2.2.txt&quot; version.<br />
Tibia version 8.5<br />
<br />
It got stuck at the chest where u get the coat. So i turned off cavebot, couldnt opened the chest without stopping it. After i opened the chest and activated the cavebot again it wanted to go down but you gotta talk to &quot;Santiogo&quot; before u can go down for the cockroaches.<br />
<br />
If u walk to &quot;Santiogo&quot; u and then activate the bot it will first talk to him and then go down to the cockroaches.<br />
<br />
I made 1 char to level 8.<br />
An other char is almost level 5 now.<br />
<br />
Script works perfectly for me accept for the chest/cockroach so if someone could fix the script then that would be awesome.</div></div><hr />
