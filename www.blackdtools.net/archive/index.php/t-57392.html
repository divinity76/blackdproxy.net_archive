<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">02-29-2012, 10:29</div></div><div class="posttext">although your suggestions might be worth noting, I hardly think they are the most needed features.<br />
<br />
Killing from a distance for instance, is a very important thing that could change how people use this bot if it was implemented.. <br />
I am too tired from work, but that is just one of the many thing that I think are more important than your suggestions.<br />
<br />
nevertheless, I like to see people giving suggestions and being active in the forums so good job for that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heman</div><div class="date">03-01-2012, 17:38</div></div><div class="posttext">When you are saying &quot;killing from a distance&quot; you must describe what you mean. Otherwise your suggestions might be worth nothing :p<br />
<br />
(Improvements) in distance pking or hunting is neccessary and is maybe important for you and you should add it to the list instead of claiming that my or anyone elses suggestions are worth nothing. <br />
<br />
I hope others do the same. All improvements are neccessary for bigger improvements. <br />
<br />
This thread I started mostly to increase the afk botting experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By hunting from a distance, I mean allowing bots to automatically 'run' creatures when they hunt. That way paladins, mages and sorcerers can hunt hard creatures without having to block them.<br />
<br />
I will post more suggestions when I get time.</div></div><hr />
