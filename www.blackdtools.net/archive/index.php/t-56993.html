The future is flash client, Cip have already stated that numerous times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They never stated that the stand alone client will ever be discontinued<br />
did they??</div></div><hr />

Flash client will remain in Beta for a long time. There are thousands of well known bugs and CIP hasn't fixed them yet. Plus, performance, due to the new Adobe updates, is being improved slowly, so its just a matter of months until they have the client 100% ready.<br />
Perhaps you remember, back when they announced flash client, they said the stand alone client code is a mess and does not allow good improvements (check differences between the Market in both clients).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said they will keep stand alone client it if the majority of the players say so. Thats what ive read on tibia forums<br />

At this moment I am trying to fix the things being detected in blackd proxy cavebot to turn it safe again,<br />
but I will never try to copy Neobot in any way if that is what you ask.</div></div><hr />
