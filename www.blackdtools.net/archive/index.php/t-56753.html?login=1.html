	<meta name="description" content="I was wondering... How SAFE are safe cheats?? All i really want is the auto-eat and the anti-idle. I want to know how undetectable it is. Like has anyone here only used safe cheats and got caught/banned/notation? Also i wouldn't mind having an answer to... How safe is the normal part of the bot? I used to use it and it worked for a while but i ended up getting banned after a while on like 2/3 of my accounts. 
If anyone can reply to this that'd be great =)  please and thanx" />
