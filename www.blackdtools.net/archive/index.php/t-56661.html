Check box to ask if your making runes, spears or just mana training so it doesnt spam if you run out of blanks or spears. 
 
Says spell between X to X mana or after mana has reached X wait random time up to X. 
 
Eating feature and logout if X feature would also be great! 
 
This would be a great little bot with this feature as im not interested in a cavebot since i acutally enjoy hunting but would like a char to make some runes overnight!" />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danieloc</div><div class="date">05-07-2012, 04:31</div></div><div class="posttext">Just came to propose this, instead of <br />
if &quot;mana is less than&quot; then press this key<br />
we need:<br />
if &quot;mana is&quot; (box with &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;) then press this key<br />
<br />
That way not much is added, just 1 small change and the bot is rune maker.</div></div><hr />
