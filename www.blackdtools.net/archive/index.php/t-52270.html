I am only unsure about the cavebot. The rest of the cheats are completely undetectable. That is sure.</div></div><hr />

a lvl 28 created 3 days ago<br />
a lvl 20 created 2 days ago<br />
a lvl 21 created 2 days ago<br />
a lvl 8 created a day ago<br />
a lvl 8 ~<br />
a lvl 8 ~<br />
<br />
But, since some of the ppl around here got banned, i would say my theory is still right<br />
&quot;they make somekind of scan on X day at X time, and they detect the character bottin at that specific time and got &quot;marked&quot; and at the end of the month they just ban it&quot; ( they should make around 2 or 3 scan a month ) <br />
<br />
maybe thats why none of mine, itihrs' chars got banned<br />
<br />
hope daniel see my theory about it, and maybe we can work on it cause i got a huge amount of chars tat i could check which date they make a scan so we can beware of not bot tat day or smthin lik tat :)<br />
<br />
kthxbye</div></div><hr />

Whatever you do after you get marked doesn't change the fact that you will get a ban in the next wave.<br />
<br />
Mexidude made all chars few days ago and only used updated version and none of their chars got a ban. So I still think that now is safe. However I am still not sure enough to claim that it is 100% safe.<br />
 <br />
Anyways 100% safety is very hard to test.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My new char was reached 8 without ban. I also have another acc witch I only botted with my bot, works as blackd(proxy) those chars is 19,13 and 12 no ban.( I even got an report)<br />
Survied 3 waves.<br />
<br />
I'm not claming its safe, but if it is blackD should be safe to, since the last update Blackd did.<br />
<br />
And alot thanks to mexidude, if blackD had more as you he would have found the detection trigger along time ago.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">09-20-2010, 20:19</div></div><div class="posttext">We are not sure about its safety right now. It is not recomended to use Blackd Proxy on your main account or even on high lvl farmers. Only on characters that you really dont care about.<br />
Anyways, if you want free cheats use Blackd Safe Cheats. They include healing, x-ray,...and they cannot be detected. I repeat, Blackd Safe Cheats are 100% safe.</div></div><hr />

Same question here :( Waiting answer to buy the best cavebot again xD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">02-17-2011, 01:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Same question here :( Waiting answer to buy the best cavebot again xD<br />
 <br />
Ask you can find by searching and reading a bit, BlackdProxy is not 100% safe. Daniel (creator of this software) believes that unless you send invalid packets you SHOULD not be banned. (Doesn't mean that you won't). <br />
<br />
Potentially, an example of an invalid packet would be trying to eat an apple from your backpack but it is not there. Arguably, CIP can detect that you tried to do something that is not possible (since the apple is not there) and know you are cheating. I am unsure of how certain this is but makes sense except when you consider lag since you could possibly try to open a door that is already opened if someone opened right before you.<br />
<br />
Sorry if its a bit confusing, I am hoping for some clarification regarding invalid packets. Nevertheless, to answer your question again, BlackdProxy is not 100% safe at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
True, but personally, I doubt they discriminate for this sort of thing.  Lag sent invalid packets will be random, since lag is random.  However, bot sent packets will form a pattern over time; i.e. patterns are recognizable = evidence of cheating = BAN.<br />
<br />
As far as BlackD, I've yet to ever be banned using it since the last MAJOR tibia update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nebel</div><div class="date">05-11-2011, 18:02</div></div><div class="posttext">So, it's evolving to the path of safety? Hope to get a rotund YES.</div></div><hr />
