<br />
You could also just bot like shit and sell the ingame gold for RL cash if your that poor in RL atm :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuffguy</div><div class="date">06-19-2011, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Id love to just pk , maybe ill join an OT or somthing because i dont have any bots or that reliable of a computer but thanks for the idea ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuffguy</div><div class="date">06-19-2011, 17:48</div></div><div class="posttext">idk, i just need to find enough $ ingame somehow to buy a 100+ char and ill start again ;P pallys my shit and idk what prices would be on that(100+pally wit decent skills/ml), any idea ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doan916</div><div class="date">06-21-2011, 02:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed with fosforo about the only 2 fun thing being pking and botting. My advice would be don't plan to spend much time and money on the game. Just take it slowly. Tibia isn't all that worthy. Not to get anyone offended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuffguy</div><div class="date">06-21-2011, 19:54</div></div><div class="posttext">oh i feel ya on not worth much $ i never paid my own prem hah always used ingame cash so dw bout that, i got like an 18 druid right now facc lol trust me im not too worried bout the game.=]</div></div><hr />
