If you want to prove this works, megavideo lets you watch 72 mins of movies a day, because it goes off your IP, just unplug the modem.  Two different situations, same answer ^.^</div></div><hr />

 <br />
in the old days when people didnt had gamer pc's they died in annih cuz if you get teleported into annih room and they spamm with gfbs, your fps could be very low and you get massiv laggs and freezes.. so maybe on that ue combo this happend to you? im not sure.. maybe just a server lagg which hitted you hardly</div></div><hr />

That's why more and more people are using skype now.  I have a pinging program, but I'll prolly be banned for uploading it here lol</div></div><hr />

Do somebody knows how could they been done it?<br />
<br />
They can get it through msn. If you accept to share/accept or any kind of file/video/audio transfer over msn, your IP is easily grabbed. And also as Jagex said, they can get it via Ventrilo aswell. There are actually countless of ways getting your IP.<br />
<br />
And Jagex, I don't really think you can solo ping down another player with just one computer. Well, maybe if you have a 100/100mbit connection and the target got like 1/1 mbit and a sucky router. But yeah, what do I know.. Correct me if I'm wrong :)<br />
<br />
And one more thing, why do you really need a tool to ping someone Jagex? Just make a batch file to send X amount of bytes to X.X.X.X IP. Then just open alot of them. But yeah, maybe more handy with a program.<br />
<br />
Also I don't think you would be banned for posting that program as you can do it via cmd. But I guess you gotta post source or something to prove it's safe.<br />

And I start wonder why the hell are you in the same vent or have your enemies on msn?<br />
<br />
Or does any one in trade says, Buying Fridays Ip for 100k hehe would be a lol message.<br />
<br />
I agree with Tony that you cant internetblock someones connection with just 1comp, sounds insane then. But wouldn't a firewall help to stop this?<br />
<br />
In my router there is an option called don't respond on ping on wan or something like that, that should help aswell.<br />
<br />
Netgear &gt; Dlink:P<br />

Here is a link to the best firewalls there is.<br />

not responding to pings won't stop flooding of the downstream</div></div><hr />
