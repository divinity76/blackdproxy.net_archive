<br />
Unline has been updated to version 10.78 !<br />
<br />
Click here  (https://www.dropbox.com/s/76cq2lhihcae05d/Unline%2010.78.exe?dl=1)to download the new version of Unline's custom client. Alternatively, you may use your own 10.78 client and IP changer.<br />
<br />
This update adds new graphics and improved animations.<br />
<br />
New VIP outfits have been implemented (addons are not yet available):<br />
Champion<br />
Conjurer<br />
Beastmaster<br />
Chaos Acolyte<br />
Death Herald<br />
Ranger<br />
Ceremonial Garb<br />
Puppeteer<br />
Spirit Caller<br />
Evoker<br />
Sea Warrior<br />
Please note that due to changes in the new client it's no longer possible to ride a mount while wearing custom outfits (e.g., Barbarian, Frog, Werewolf) as this would result in debugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">botterful</div><div class="date">10-02-2015, 05:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Free-To-Play<br />
<br />
As you may have noticed, the pay-to-win (p2w) game mechanics have been taking away the fun factor from Unline.<br />
<br />
After much feedback, the Unline staff has decided to make Unline a completely free-to-play server to play on. Please note that if required we may introduce ads to the website in the future.<br />
<br />
A new NPC that allows you to purchase VIP time with ingame money has been added to Neapolis. Additional items (not new) will be added to the NPC in a future update.</div></div><hr />
