Regardless of the order I open MCs, or log in, Cheatlyzer only detects the first Character I log in with, however, if I logout and close the window the Character was on, Cheatlyzer switches to the second one, so not sure if there is something wrong with the program, or I'm doing something wrong myself, feel free" />
