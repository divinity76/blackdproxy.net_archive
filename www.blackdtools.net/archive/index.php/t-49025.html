<br />
When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?<br />
<br />
I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br />
<br />
I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15:19- 24. The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br />
<br />
Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?<br />
<br />
I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?<br />
<br />
A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality. I don't agree. Can you settle this?<br />
<br />
Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?<br />
<br />
Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev. 19:27. How should they die?<br />
<br />
I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?<br />
<br />
My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)<br />
<br />
I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.</div></div><hr />

21,1 Und der HERR sprach zu Mose: Rede zu den Priestern, den Söhnen Aarons, und sage zu ihnen: Keiner von ihnen darf sich an einer Leiche unrein machen unter seinen Volksgenossen: 21,2 ausser an seiner Blutsverwandtschaft, die ihm nahesteht: an seiner Mutter und an seinem Vater, seinem Sohn, seiner Tochter und seinem Bruder 21,3 und an seiner Schwester, der Jungfrau, die ihm nahesteht, die noch keinem Mann [zu eigen] geworden ist: wegen dieser darf er sich unrein machen.<br />
<br />
Short evalutation:<br />
Tell the priests that they should not defile themselvs with dead bodies EXCEPT the dead bodies of your relatives, your mother, father, son, doughter and brother, sister and a virgin that is related to you in some way, with those they can defile themself<br />

I am a Pentecostal Christian. So tell me how am I poisoned.<br />
<br />
@the topic maker: That was on the old testament. Which was the old law.<br />
<br />
You should read all the bible if you are going to make any assumptions.<br />
Here from Matthew 5:17<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Fulfillment of the Law<br />
 17&quot;Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.<br />

My point, I`m more to mystical things, believe more in nature and spiritual things than a human-being God like most relegions describe. Why the hell someone that knows everything going inside you will punish you to burn forevah, its pointless, everyone can change and mostly are not their own fault only.

You have clearly mistaken the context of the bible. God knows everything whenever it comes to action's outcomes.<br />

<br />
For example<br />
<br />
<br />
Choice 1 ones which leads to outcome 1, then you got choice 2 depending on the first outcome and so on.<br />

So god's word changes with time? I though he knew everything and could look into future. so why would he adjust it later?<br />

<br />
It doesn't change I think I am not explaning myself or you are not understanding me. Because you have the free will. Have you ever heard about the 2 universe theory?.<br />
I will put a very raw and missleaded example but still an example:<br />
Lets say you are training your dog not to bite your shoes. In one hand you got a shoe and in the other hand you got a treat. If the dog takes the shoe you will smack him with a newspaper. Lets say he does this 4 times in a row. Then he takes the treat instead of the shoe and he gets a &quot;good boy&quot;. You knew both posible outcomes, perhaps not at first sight but you still did.<br />
<br />
I will not answer that question, it is not in me to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is because religious people usually get a feeling of power which doesn't belong to them. Also this thread was about the bible and I was defending the bible. Is up to each people how do they want to take their religion. I could introduce you a few thousand that aren't murderers or anything alike.</div></div><hr />

You should read all the bible if you are going to make any assumptions.<br />
Here from Matthew 5:17<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any other questions feel free to ask me<br />
<br />
I must say I am confused with the whole old testament new testament, At what point in time did jesus come back to life and have another bunch of people follow him around writing shit down? Or wait... is it just a rewrite for new ages because our MORALS have changed?<br />
<br />
While our morals change, how does gods word change? who has the right to rewrite the bible? and why does the new testament still state that child slavery (or any slavery) is ok?<br />
<br />
How is killing in the name of a legend ok? Do you realise if YOU WERE BORN IN an arabic country you would have different beliefs?<br />
<br />
Religion is simple, its something we all &lt;needed&gt; But because the size of the world, not everyone believes the same thing.<br />
<br />
History is decided by the victor, have you heard this quote before? something to think about, the papal states won LOTS OF WARS, and changed the face of history, writing their religion as the correct one.<br />
<br />
USA is (somewhat losing) the war in Iraq, and are eventually pulling out, does that mean the Iraqi god is the real god? After all, battles were fought are were believed to be won in the name of god, if you lost, god did not favor you.<br />
<br />
Religion is nothing but a brain wash , something 90%of all of us were taught growing up, the easiest time to scribe such a joke into a humans mind. Thats why arabs believe in their gods, why you believe in yours and why asians believe in theirs.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, religion is good in some ways but used politically it is a weapon to powerfull to use. religion is a nice thought, I sometimes wish it were true, that something would prove it to me, but there is no facts for it just some man made book telling me what to do.<br />
<br />
If you are religous THATS FINE! but dont go around telling other people how to live their lives and why, you chose to live you life the way you want, let them chose the way they want.<br />
<br />
So just remember, what religion you are, depends on where you grow up, not if its true or not. hopefully thinking about that will help you realise what a disaster it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just ask yourself, why is your religion the correct one? How does your religion disprove all other religions (and dont quote something from the bible)<br />
<br />
<br />
That is because religious people usually get a feeling of power which doesn't belong to them. Also this thread was about the bible and I was defending the bible. Is up to each people how do they want to take their religion. I could introduce you a few thousand that aren't murderers or anything alike.<br />
<br />
lol and i can introduce you to a ton of atheiest non murderers? how does that prove anything lol also check this out because you need to read this<br />
most important, 10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2 and 1 hopefully some eye openers for you, also FOSSILS FOSSILS ILS, god damn (oh no im going to helll) bones disprove your religion, thus no need for even an argument, unless ofcourse you blindly follow such a belief<br />
http://img696.imageshack.us/img696/2685/1259138083133.jpg<br />
<br />
Have you ever realised how the worlds smartest people are athiests, while the dumbest simply blindly follow religion?<br />
<br />
That all said, I would love to be a christian goto church etc, I just need the damn proof that theres something out there.<br />
<br />
And lets face it no one will ever know until &quot;another&quot; coming.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: he says you are poisoned, because eventually you will spread your disease to your offspring, who will spread it to theirs and so on and so on and so on....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sweet, lets see the statistics, oh wait... they dont exist?.... oh wait thats something you heard in church so it must be true? <br />
<br />
then let me ask you this, if Christianity is the true religion, that means arabian wars are UNJUST meaning they are all blindly murdering people because they feel it the right thing to do, wich makes them all MURDERERS and if theirs is right, yours is not.<br />
<br />
read first paragraph of http://home.comcast.net/~pobrien48/serial_killers.htm<br />
<br />
Point and case :O?<br />
<br />
&quot;Studies after study show serial killers are a product of this environment, not genetics.&quot; enviroment being a religous home<br />
<br />
What about hitler, he COULDNT of been religous right? &quot;Hitler was a Roman Catholic alter Boy and wrote of wanting to  be a Catholic priest. He and his men in charge of killing six million Jews were Catholic religious fanatics until death. &quot; WRONG<br />
<br />
That all said, I guess if your religous you should agree that the holacoust was a good thing?</div></div><hr />

We could be the first species to inhabit more then one planet, we could also be the last<br />
We could be the smartest species, we could also be the dumbest<br />
there could be a species who has all the answers, and maybe theres not<br />
perhaps we are nothing but offspring of another species igniting a match, and perhaps we are the largest form of life, but for anyone to deny all posibilities that contradict what a book said that was written thousands of years ago, then i truly feel bad for those people, for they will never know true freedom.<br />

I believe everyone has the right to follow what they believe, but I also believe everyone has the right to lead, to create, and to love even if they are homosexual(altho i will admit hanging around gays does make me feel awq. lol) but thats who I am, and you are you. I cant change your mind, just like you cant; mine. But I should ask you, who lives more freely? <br />
<br />
I smoke alot of pot, sometimes I toke and I lay down relax, and just think, sometimes for hours. Usually about our creation, and our destruction. The two answers humans will never know the answer too, even if they are fooling themselves into thinking they do know.<br />
<br />
But when I do this, I have thought about how is it people are so certain, their gods are real, and just simply disvalue and disrespect other religions? how can you simply, pick a religion without being born into it? They all say they are true, they all have millions of followers (usually of the same race) take american africans for example, They were tribesmen in Africa, believed in very strange ritualtistic religions, some even scary, thousands were then caught, sold into slavery, slavery then abolished, the africans had kids of there own, eventually joined into society (even tho because of racism not completly, but thats something completely different :P) the africans who had more kids, and they all (well not all) went into religions, and I bet you none of them went back to being a tribesman lol. thus proving the point its all about where you grow up, how you grow up (to continue the belief) and how you teach your children (to continue it), ok im done on this matter lol<br />
<br />
But hey what the fuck do I know? :P<br />
<br />
Science can lead us to our enlightenment, but also our destruction JUST LIKE RELIGION</div></div><hr />

EDIT: I will definitively not be today. I spent 12 hours on the school then 4 on the church and haven't eat for 14 hours and I am extremely tired, so tomorrow you'll have the response you deserve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aurum</div><div class="date">03-24-2010, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">even though i don't believe in god or any religion... i still think religion is something beautiful (not in all aspects) ONLY in the feeling of &quot;beign&quot; protected by the &quot;all powerful&quot;. all my family is catholic/christian and since i was a little kid they teached me to go to church, pray, and love god (but i'm more attracted by science and there is still no proof of all related to religions). But they respect my opinion and i respect theirs. The FE is also beautiful, just the feeling of acting &quot;right&quot; and that god actually see it, is something that a lot of people actually need, love and value. The need of pray to &quot;someone&quot; to save a family member in a crisis, or to help you in bad times, is also a way people don't feel &quot;alone&quot;<br />
<br />
So... when someone comes to tell u &quot;hey love god!!&quot; just respect his/her beliefs, and those who are catholics/christians (as webber said) stop telling people to love &quot;somebody&quot; who they don't believe in<br />
<br />
<br />

Do you know that Islamic people and Jewish/Christian people believe in the same God just from a different point of view? (I won't go in details). Ishmael and Isaac where half brothers, both sons of Abraham. Ishmael (just like Abraham) is considered the father of the Islam ism.<br />

History is decided by the victor, have you heard this quote before? something to think about, the papal states won LOTS OF WARS, and changed the face of history, writing their religion as the correct one.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are talking about all those countries on which Rome forced the Catholicism. I am a Chrstian, a Jewish Christian actually (Jewish is a way to name my bloodline since you stop being jewish when you believe in Christ as the messiah)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also FOSSILS FOSSILS ILS, god damn (oh no im going to helll) bones disprove your religion<br />
<br />
Can you explain me how fossils disprove my religion?<br />

Have you ever realised how the worlds smartest people are athiests, while the dumbest simply blindly follow religion?<br />

Einstein was the offspring of a jewish family he believed in God perhaps not in the same way that everybody else, but he did believe (I guess his belief is called Phanteism or something like that)<br />
Sir Isaac Newton was also one of the brightest minds in the history and he was a devout Christian.<br />
Irany/i (dunno how to spell it) scientists are great minds nowaday and they are also believers.<br />

he says you are poisoned, because eventually you will spread your disease to your offspring, who will spread it to theirs and so on and so on and so on.<br />

I was &quot;forced&quot; while I was underage because as everybody knows kids cannot decide on their own. My grandma (mother of my father) is a devote Catholic so she made my father baptise me as a Catholic. My mother (which comes from the jewish bloodline) took me to Christian summer schools. My father was a mason so he didn't ever forced me to believe in anything. From the time I chose to follow my faith everybody respected it. Even better my father did the Anti-mason trial and choose to be a lamb again (you need to know more about masons if you want me to keep talking about this), and he is a Christian now.<br />
<br />
I am a man of science I am on med school atm. I respect the science because its honorable what they do. They try to explain the things my God created.<br />
<br />
I really don't know if I missed out a point but you can keep the questions comming</div></div><hr />

He and his men in charge of killing six million Jews were Catholic religious fanatics until death. &quot; WRONG<br />
<br />
That all said, I guess if your religous you should agree that the holacoust was a good thing?<br />
<br />
I am defending the bible and Christianity not anything else. And about the statics what the heck are you talking about? o.o</div></div><hr />

I can assure you that your freedom is nothing compared to mine. If you want know what I am talking about, live it? Cuz I've been where you've been and even worse.<br />

But when I do this, I have thought about how is it people are so certain, their gods are real, and just simply disvalue and disrespect other religions? <br />
<br />
<br />
Their gods are real, you can make anything a god. Most of their gods are spirits. And how do I disvalue their beliefs? Because I've been infront of those people and I've seen how their &quot;gods&quot; end up running scared away of my God. The human spirit is the only one that is not afraid of God and its because of the lack of knowledge and understanding.</div></div><hr />

I really mean everything I am saying. I am sorry if I do not explain myself in a way in which you guys could understand I am not as lawyer (this is the meaning of the word not the actual lawyer who defends the laws lol) as I wish I where.<br />
<br />
I could keep answering you and we would probably never end. All I intended to do is to defend the bible since the guy who created the post was totally wrong about the meaning he was giving to it.</div></div><hr />

Thats why Im going to close this thread, there is no sense in trying to disprove eachother when we are both convinced of our beliefs, I guess some people find it easy to believe, I on the other hand do not.</div></div><hr />

You were talking about freedom with weeber, here is the example... we can be free as soon we can choose, you can't. You have to base your life in a book.</div></div><hr />
