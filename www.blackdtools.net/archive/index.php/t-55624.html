He was selling me an account and I sent him the money on paypal 100$ USD and he logged off msn messenger. And never gave me the information.<br />

He says:<br />

<br />
ME:<br />
I also have chatlogs of Msn messenger which I could provide for evidence in this matter If needed. He sent me false account information and then logged off Msn. I'd just like to have my money back if possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then thats it so far. But I was wondering chances of me getting my money back does paypal dispute usually work in favor for the buyer? Or do they look at the situation from both seller and buyer responses?<br />
<br />
What else could I say to get my money back?<br />
<br />
Please help!!! Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is rather usual to paypal account holders.. <br />
but as a buyer in this kind of fraud you had luck you were on paypal..<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck to you, and hope everything goes as planned, have a nice day :)</div></div><hr />
