I just wanted to say, that I got banished until deletion, because of Blackd Proxy I think... 
I used only the skillbot, Cipsoft said, it was automatically detected, so I stop playing real Tibia and play OT with the Bot.

Back in the day before detection tools i used NG. used to be a good bot. but more recently i dont trust it. the last couple months i started playing again. when i saw they had done a ban the other day my heart stopped. i have two accounts going that day that i had never played manually even once. i had also used blackd on my main to write a script and test only 1 time. to my wonderful suprise none of these accounts got messed with (: rock on blackd i did something right wish i cud tell ya what. the conclusion i have been coming to is for the last ban cip solely relied on players reports. thats why people from all bots got a couple deletes and some people that havent even botted got deletes</div></div><hr />
