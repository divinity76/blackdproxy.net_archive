GAMECLIENT1&gt;( hex ) 09 00 96 05 05 00 03 00 2E 2E 2E <br />
 <br />
So after some research you get to see that it is a about a header, a 96 05 05 00 , and a string in hex values, so you can build your own cheat there to talk in trade channel:<br />
 <br />
exiva &gt; 96 05 05 00 $hex-tibiastr:hello$<br />
 <br />
(this command will say hello in trade channel)<br />
 <br />
Note that you should not include the header (09 00) as the own command will build it to match the length of the packet.<br />
 <br />
Now almost all will be scriptable. Note that this can be integrated in cavebots:<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
sayMessage exiva &gt; 96 05 05 00 $hex-tibiastr:selling firesword 5k thais$<br />
wait 125<br />
gotoScriptline 0<br />
<br />
 <br />
There you have a simple trade channel spammer.<br />
 <br />
This is only a simple example. You can see some more in the edronbps.txt , a cavebot script that can buy you 5 bps of blanks, in edron.</div></div><hr />

This command will move your left hand item to main backpack<br />
exiva &gt; 78 FF FF 06 00 00 $hex-equiped-item:06$ 00 FF FF 03 00 00 01 <br />
 <br />
This old command will move a firesword to your left hand:<br />
 <br />
exiva #D0 0C 06<br />
 <br />
and yes, Fry, new commands and variables will come. This is only the start of a new generation of commands that will allow advanced scripts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">11-26-2006, 00:44</div></div><div class="posttext">to make your own command just enable the log exactly during the action you want to record and disable it after, then search for last gameclient packet. Here is another example: the yell command<br />
 <br />
here I yelled some points:<br />
 <br />
HH:MM XXXXXXXX [XXX]: ................<br />
 <br />
GAMECLIENT1&gt;( hex ) 14 00 96 03 10 00 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E 2E <br />
 <br />
so the yell command is<br />
 <br />
exiva &gt; 96 03 $hex-tibiastr:hello$</div></div><hr />

suppose you want to make the cavebot move your firesword from hand to bp.<br />
Then you make the script, but it would only work if you are using a firesword. And you would have to edit it for the item you are  currently using. Instead you could tell the proxy before moving the sword to bp, to copy the item's ID in left hand to a temporal memory (like a calculator) and then tell the proxy to move whatever's item ID is on the memory to the bp. That way the script would work with any item in left hand.<br />
<br />
hope i made myself clear</div></div><hr />

I would like to see them, I allways tought it would be easier to make scripts then. It could just be like.<br />
<br />
UsrVar1<br />
UsrVar2<br />
<br />
etc till 9<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weeper</div><div class="date">11-29-2006, 07:18</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah :D<br />
and add functions like add var1 +1 so variables can hold numerical values. Then some really cool stuff can b made with the scripts.</div></div><hr />

1. You know how to edit (edited that post). Good, then why not edit the previous one. Ok I got it sorry, forget about it. So we realize you posted new shit. Good: point for you.<br />
<br />
2. You cannot follow last attacked creature cause the attack packet contains monster ID and you have to know it's id (even if you managed to knew it, Blackd hasn't variables to handle it). So that's not possible ATM. (Point for me ;P )<br />
<br />
3. Minimizing BPs is done by memory, not packets. So no :P (2-1)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Steeled</div><div class="date">12-02-2006, 02:27</div></div><div class="posttext">lets do a little list<br />
 <br />
moves:<br />
exiva &gt; 65 - move up<br />
exiva &gt; 66 - move right<br />
exiva &gt; 67 - move down<br />
exiva &gt; 68 - move left<br />
 <br />
says: (as you can see say is 96, and it's followed by the type)<br />
exiva &gt; 96 01 $hex-tibiastr:hello$ - say hello<br />
exiva &gt; 96 02 $hex-tibiastr:hello$ - say hello<br />
exiva &gt; 96 03 $hex-tibiastr:hello$ - yell hello<br />
 <br />
exiva &gt; A1 $hex-idofname:scarab$ - Attack a Scarab! (exiva &gt; A1 $hex-idofname:larva$ - is not attacking larvas I dunno why (it says Target Lost... I think it's getting the ID of a larva far from me))<br />
exiva &gt; A2 $hex-idofname:scarab$ - Follow a Scarab! (same problem as up)<br />
 <br />
Note from blackd: Very nice post. I must warn however that some commands only will work as intended if you have Blackd Proxy 9.06 or a higher version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
$hex-lastattackedid$ returns (hex) ID of last attacked creature or player<br />

I guess this is the command<br />
exiva &gt; A2 $hex-lastattackedid$</div></div><hr />

Hey fry if this guy is right then our score would be 2-1 me winning :D<br />
muahahah<br />
<br />
thx steeled<br />
<br />
EDIT: It worked!! but with this one<br />
exiva &gt; A2 $hex-idofname:PERSON$   <br />
I got a problem now if it's not possible then I would like it to be a proposal.<br />
<br />
exiva &gt; A2 $hex-idofname:$lastsender$$   &lt;---- that one doesnt work   i want it to follow the person who sent the command &quot;!follow&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-02-2006, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">exiva &gt; A2 $hex-idofname:$lastsender$$<br />
 <br />
this will not work as the parser will see 4 parts there:<br />
1. exiva &gt; A2 <br />
2. $hex-idofname:$<br />
3. lastsender<br />
4. $$<br />
 <br />
Instead of that you should do:<br />
 <br />
exiva &gt; A2 $hex-idofname:{$lastsender$}$<br />
 <br />
(THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE IN BLACKD PROXY 9.06 OR HIGHER)</div></div><hr />

You dont need to be an expert to use 90 % of the features of Blackd Proxy, but (of course) being an expert helps to use it at 100 %</div></div><hr />
