I had been botting ALOT on multiple characters on the account. anywhere and everywhere. hours and hours. And then yesterday I decide to make a rook script. Well, It got stuck saying &quot;You cannot go there&quot; for over 20 minutes while i was not at the computer. And Then i just so happened to get banned the next day. It must be obvious to the client that my bot was trying to go up a floor or something when it can not.<br />
<br />
<br />
So just a little tip, DO NOT USE SCRIPTS THAT GET STUCK and or ARE BUGGED!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I never really botted OTT<br />
<br />
Until last month!<br />
<br />
I started free account knights left right and centre, more than half the scripts I used were bugged to SHIT! I had to walk them half the cave xD <br />
<br />
But anyway! <br />
<br />
I used lighthax tibiacharactername in taskbar all stealth modes off and random timers OFF.<br />
<br />
All you gotta do is remove fucking BOTDETECTION.EXE from your tibiafile lol<br />
<br />
<br />
[patch.exe] for the noobs</div></div><hr />

So that is obviously not the case. I have botted many many more accounts besides this one, but this is the only one I used that script on. Otherwise ALL botting procedures were exactly the same. And that is the only account I got banned on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Long story short, it was obviously due to a bugged script or I would have been banned on the other accounts aswell.</div></div><hr />

I am 100% sure you are lieing about removing patch.exe. You probably just don't think you have it. lul.<br />
<br />
Man how do you update your client without it? ;)</div></div><hr />
