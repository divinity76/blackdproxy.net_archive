I'm affraid you can't do anything, just do it with more caution next time.. :S</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadow1</div><div class="date">12-07-2010, 19:17</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. you could probably take legal actions..I've never had to do anything like that but I've seen others..I guess I'd wait for someone whos maybe done it already or knows what to do, but I'm guessing call your bank? Or call paypal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keno</div><div class="date">12-07-2010, 20:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to tell thanks to the guy who scammed me - great job. I'm gonna delete my accounts or do something worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexxis123</div><div class="date">12-07-2010, 20:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats just stupid to do<br />
<br />
I know your pissed but just suck it up nothing else to do think twice before you do anythin stupid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadow1</div><div class="date">12-07-2010, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I've never thought of doing anything stupider...deleting your account. I mean cause its a game, it ends everywhere for someone, but just thats what u gotta expect when ur trading. Its hard to find trusty people but their out there..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-07-2010, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably the best thing to do is gather all the information and go to the police.<br />
Paypal is not responsible any more for game items. Hence, even if you have proofs paypal wont give you anything back. Neither your bank.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, going to a police officer and report the case might result into something.<br />
Please, consider the deletion of your accounts. Might not be the best solution. Wait some days, cooldown yourself and then think if that is what you really want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">12-08-2010, 05:25</div></div><div class="posttext">If he did chargeback on bank transfer, check if you still have the cash asap, and talk with your bank representatives. It can be solved this way, Im sure since Ive heard that people that are afraid of a chargeback do it this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keno</div><div class="date">12-08-2010, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm lame at these things...<br />
We talked on MSN that he will log in Candia and he sends me 40$ first. I agreed and he did and I gave him 1kk. Then he sent me 310$ and I gave him 8kk :/. And after few hrs when I logged in paypal again I saw there is case opened (chargeback it's called?). And he ignored me on MSN and forum.<br />
In short: He sent me 40$ on Paypal (verified account) and after few mins 310$. I added it up and withdrawed (to my irl bank) and few hrs later I saw there is opened case... and the withdraw is cancelled.<br />
<br />
And I want to ask one more question: are screens/videos proof in Paypal?<br />
<br />
That kinda sucks, that I've never scammed anyone and now all is against me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">12-08-2010, 17:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Contact paypal then, since the chargeback was done thru it. Just tell them that you sold some goods to someone and now he is doing chargeback, and that they shouldnt allow it. Tell them to hold the case a little longer and to tell you what to do to prove the transaction true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keno</div><div class="date">12-09-2010, 15:47</div></div><div class="posttext">One more question: does paypal have polish supporter (or someone like this?) (to help in things like these). Cause I really hate scammers and I want to punish him. And that's quite much money in Poland...</div></div><hr />
