1. By default the priorities are locked, just to be sure you don't misclick on them. If you want to change them then first uncheck this.<br />
 <br />
2. Blackd Proxy: how much priority should Blackd Proxy have over the CPU. A lot would be bad, too few would be worse.<br />
 <br />
3. Tibia clients: how much priority should Tibia have over the CPU. It is usually not a good idea to change this one, specially if you multiclient.<br />
 <br />
4. Apply priority: Apply any change made on the priorities by pressing this button. (you won't be able to press it if the checkbox &lt;1&gt; is checked)<br />
 <br />
5. Here you can select config settings for other versions of Tibia (to play OTs)<br />
 <br />
6. Do it : This load the settings selected on &lt;5&gt; and closes blackd proxy. Next time you open blackd proxy it will be ready for that tibia version.<br />
 <br />
7. UPDATE THIS LIST: This update the list of Tibia clients.<br />
 <br />
8. Client selector: It requires you update it first (press button &lt;7&gt; ) then you can see and select a tibia client, even if it is closed or not linked with blackd proxy (will show as not connected)<br />
 <br />
9. SET 0FPS: This will change the FPS to 0,5 (not really 0, as that would give some problems) This save a lot of CPU. <br />
 <br />
10. SET 25FP: This will change the FPS to 25 (Fastest way to take back the control of a client previously set to 0FPS)</div></div><hr />

i tried to change the client to 7.6 (playing ots only)<br />
so i did, i pressed 7.6 on the client which normally says its 8.11 and pressed &quot;DO IT WILL CLOSE ALL&quot;<br />
proxy automaticly closed and i re-opened it, it actually should be for 7.6 clients only now but again, it says its 8.11<br />
nomatter how many times i try, when i re-open it, altho i changed the client (5.), it keeps giving client 8.11 <br />
<br />
my real friend is also having this problem, how to solve this?<br />
<br />
i hope i will get an answer as quick as possible since my days are expiring now ://</div></div><hr />
