So ya, I planned to start botting them today again. 
Won't post goals or any other crap and just start rightaway.

But the spot still gives problems every now and then.<br />
Since all chars are botting minos I started using a skinning hotkey.<br />
<br />
#1 Died 3 times since the last update, 2x by the same trapper. Now I'm using a hotkey on all chars which will make an alert if a char is idle for 10 seconds.<br />
Although it has grown 1 level since last update, its axe skill just went down badly..<br />

<br />
#2 Didn't die since last update, isn't giving problems either. Hope to get enough cash to upgrade the equipment for this fellow.<br />

<br />
#3 Low Lvl pvp knight, is doing OK too. Bought obsidian knife, so back to botting 2morrow. Although today I saw someone summoning DSes, ran to dp and didn't hear anything from the guy anymore.<br />

<br />
#4 The highest char, going the best. Because in this place max 4 people come there a day. Gained a lvl too. Hope to buy a SCA soon.<br />
