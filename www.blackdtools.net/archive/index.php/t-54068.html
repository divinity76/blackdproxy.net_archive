I went the risk to trust him blindly, giving account+email first and then after 3 days, no money arrived.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Imdaboss</div><div class="date">01-25-2011, 18:59</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume because M5city has several accounts on this forum to fool people with fake vouches etc. This way, the mod makes sure that at least one of his accounts sees this. That is my guess, at least.</div></div><hr />

Check this post please. I think that is proof enough to show that he is lying (in addition to all what people have been saying for the last months) : <br />

<br />
Compare: In the public thread, he says he sent 50$ (even though the price was 70$ btw. why would he send 50? Especially when he considers 70$ already incredibly cheap)<br />
<br />
With: In the screen shot you see his PM to me where he wrote that the money was &quot;on hold&quot;. So no 50$ for me.</div></div><hr />
