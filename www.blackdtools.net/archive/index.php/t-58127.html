<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">05-21-2012, 15:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Simple. Open all the backpacks you have on you and minimize them.<br />
<br />
But if you're talking about the continuous looting of gold with depositing, then you should implent :depositer section in your script. That will cause it botting for endless hours. D:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BelowtheB</div><div class="date">05-21-2012, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">That was quick, currently testing my bot with all the bags opened and minimized :)<br />
<br />
And I have read up on and looked at several depositors, the only thing holding me back from that route currently is my lack of knowledge on doors, I have seen a few out dated guides and then a recent good one however it is for locked doors and I currently just need a regular door opener.  Normally I'd use allot of trial and error in learning, however I am always cautious with this because a screw up could lead to a ban, and I'd like to fully understand the functions I add to my scripts before I release them.<br />
<br />
That said..  If you have any tips on how to properly open doors (i.e the commands for checking if its open or closed, and executing what to do from the based on the latter) or any examples of working door scripts, I can assure you it will not fall on deaf ears :)<br />

Thanks again for your time Provocate &amp; other readers</div></div><hr />

I got an idea, it should work, if you want you can be the 'test' bunny ^^. Let me know and I'll post tutorial here. It might just work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BelowtheB</div><div class="date">05-23-2012, 06:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a bunny sounds exciting! :P<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, I'll try and get you the screenshots tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The 2 Doors Im trying to open (well, 1 of them would be fine)  are the 2 located in the south-west wall of the Edron Caste.<br />
<br />
It is where you come back from the Edron Troll spawn, up through the sewer grates into the tower wall. <br />
<br />
They are usually open, but &quot;usually&quot; is a bad idea when your botting or writing scripts you are likely to share with others.</div></div><hr />
