I read the forums rules and it seemed fine to talk about this, if not just delete the thread and please don't ban me xD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pater</div><div class="date">03-31-2011, 10:18</div></div><div class="posttext">u can do it as with current client - create proxy or hook receive function.</div></div><hr />

First of all, where did you read that the old client will be discontinued? that is what everybody thinks, but I didn't read that from Cipsoft yet.<br />
 <br />
Some thoughts about flash client:<br />
- just change the ip where it is connecting to 127.0.0.1 and you have the start of a new proxy bot.<br />
- make your own cheat-browser and you should be able to handle the flash object without need of injection.<br />
- I think will be very hard for Cipsoft to detect bots with the flash client. A flash object can't find much information outside the browser.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Flash client will replace the current client sooner or later. Why? Because it will be so much better when we are done with tapping its full potential. <br />
However, as long as both clients coexist the Flash client should be in no way inferior to the current client. That's why we used the term &quot;real alternative&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">06-03-2011, 01:19</div></div><div class="posttext">well, I think I wil have time to develop a new bot before the old client stops working... but first I need a working flash client.<br />
 <br />
I was not able to test the flash client yet. I have been trying it from time to time and I only get a server down message:<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Service Unavailable<br />
The server is temporarily unable to service your request. Please try again later.<br />

 <br />
Flash client is not even a real alternative yet. Too many fails. Maybe an epic fail itself. Considering the limits of flash programming... maybe the will never reach to their intended goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">06-05-2011, 16:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Well flash is going to be the very new client. instead of programming the &quot;c++&quot; version of the client for for example Mac, Android, iOS, WindowsPhone? and future tablets(Android,Windows,Linux?).. i think the Flash client will be an alternative for the moment..<br />
<br />
Flash(action script) is a well updated kind of language at the time.. and it's probably not the best and stable kind of language there is at the moment.. (well i don't know so much)<br />
<br />
The new flash client, well as far as i have seen the new client has a well made UI(User Interface), which i would LOVE in a new &quot;c++&quot; client version.. Maybe a whole new remade client for DirectX 10+ and fix it's problems it should be the best..<br />
<br />
Cheat's and bots? yeah there is always a way to do it.. but depending on the new structures and how it works exactly, probably isn't the easiest thing..</div></div><hr />

This was too short xD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">06-18-2011, 04:07</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a flash release on tprogramming, with the whole TibiaFlash client &quot;Source&quot; well all the client files as i know.. so if you want it there is a download on their forum..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">07-03-2011, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">well, that famous tibiaflash client source code is only a raw decompilation of the swf file, but it is far from a perfect decompilation. It is not enough to rebuild the client with cheats. However it might help in some way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">killemal</div><div class="date">01-15-2012, 23:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a experinced flash hacker :). This used to be alot easier than it is now but for games made in flash as2 it was possible to just add the shockwaveflash component to a vb6 project and use the Getvarible/Setvarible methods of the .ocx to set values in flash games. You could also inject functions like so<br />
<br />
Inside inject.swf:<br />
_level0.somefunction();<br />
<br />
then in vb6 call shockwave.loadmovie(PATH_TO_iNJECT.SWF,99)<br />
<br />
however tibia is not made in as2 it is made in as3 witch is much more secure. This does not mean it is not possible just that the approach is different. To hack as3 games you need to download flash as3 and load the game.swf into a new as3 project something like so:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
package{<br />
   import flash.display.*;<br />
   import flash.net.URLRequest;<br />
   import flash.display.Loader;<br />
   import flash.events.*;<br />
   <br />
   public class loaderC extends MovieClip{<br />
      public function loaderC():void{<br />
         var btn0 = new btn();<br />
         addChild(btn0);<br />
         var swfLoader:Loader = new Loader();<br />
         addChild(swfLoader);<br />
         var bgURL:URLRequest = new URLRequest(&quot;SWfURl&quot;);<br />
         swfLoader.load(bgURL);<br />
         swfLoader.x = 100;<br />
         swfLoader.y = 100;<br />
         btn0.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, doSmt);<br />
      }<br />
      public function doSmt(e:MouseEvent){<br />
         trace(&quot;btn pressed&quot;);<br />
<br />
         mczz = swfLoader.content as MovieClip;<br />
      mczz.classname.varname = 999999; //Set a varible<br />
mczz.classname.functionname(); //call a function<br />
<br />
      }<br />
   }</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldpot</div><div class="date">01-16-2012, 01:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Pm if you no how to multi-client on tibia flash and not just using different webbrowsers.<br />
If you want to know no flash bot would be safe via would be detectable with there flash client. If you are a programmer with skills and you want to try a method I use for flash client here it is. I also use blackdproxy. Can create this if you want this is just a easy way to macro flashclient. <br />
Make a webbrowser in Visualbasic6 add secondmouse function and then add a macro into webbrowser it with a script editor now you are able to to macro any process and edit the script for key functions. AutomaitionTibiaBrowser would make it able to ur undetected and you can add in different things it all depends on levels and skill of coding or making automation bots for game. If you would like to get started automating the tibiaflash client there is a software called Automationanywhere and it can be used with right skill and knowledge to safely macro every single there is to do with computers and servers. Also can compile your automated tasks or scripts and run them as a bot and also browse freely on facebook or movie wat ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">killemal</div><div class="date">01-16-2012, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually there are a few benefits to doing it with flash:<br />
<br />
If you use varibles/function names for instance ur bot would never need updating. Also by having full access to every original tibia function you can do a lot more with tibias own code. They will not detect there own functions as cheats.<br />
<br />
Also any client side detection on the flash bot would be viewable by decompiling the games swfs with a tool like sothink swf decompiler. I do not think there is any but I have not done much work on tibia yet.<br />
<br />
If cheat detection functions exist in the c++ client they would probly be simulated in the flash one. It could be usefull to look at if only too verify detection is indeed server side.</div></div><hr />

I just starting to read on this again and found a couple posts, but nothing too interesting ;(</div></div><hr />
