I ordered 1 month with Daopay and I entered my mail and stuff yea.. the payment was done and It even said &quot;Payment Done&quot; on the blackd website... Anyways when I logged onto my Blackd account to download the bot but It says my account has expired and I tried to change email, receive a new password to my mail but Im not getting the emails so I guess something is wrong.

Doesn't sound like you did. Sounds like you've opened a whole new blackd account. Check the E-mail you signed up with this time and you should get an email from Daniel with your acc details</div></div><hr />
