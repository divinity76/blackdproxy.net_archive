If he couldn't find the password, he clearly cannot read. So why try and repeat it again? He should have posted his phone number so we could ring him and tell him the password :/</div></div><hr />

Well I don't know about you guys, but I usually skip that service agreement in most cases or whatever. I know it's wrong, I know everyone installing any kind of software should read through that, but come on, who does that these days? (Well of course, some always so, but majority ... nah) I guess, everyone is just skipping that and then they're left in doubts about password.<br />
<br />
Besides I only reply to these kind of threads, if I know the answer, even though I recently got a reply ''Fu*k off bi*ch'' by someone who asked how could he edit tibia .dat file and me answering he should head off to otland.net (OpenTibia community) where he would for sure find appropriate program.<br />
<br />
I just like to help. :3</div></div><hr />
