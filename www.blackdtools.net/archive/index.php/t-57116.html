<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">01-22-2012, 21:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so the point of this project is to get some cool rewards from Santa Claus! Last Christmas (a month ago) I got Amulet of Loss and I was like: 'What the hell?! An aol? Like 40k for free?' so after checking tibia.wikia.com (if it is to be believed) I decided to make shit loads of characters. I might get Bunny Slippers or Teddy Bear as well! :D We'll see how it goes, meanwhile I can check how decectable BlackD Proxy really is. First two accounts are already finished. Screenshots below. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">679alex</div><div class="date">01-28-2012, 17:47</div></div><div class="posttext">wow xD 20+ acc ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">01-29-2012, 02:25</div></div><div class="posttext">@679alex ... 50 accounts with 20 characters on each to be exact. ^_^<br />
<br />
OT: Haven't been botting these days, internet connection is bitchin' me up :| ... Also, I'm sooooooo lazy! xD ... Of course, updates are coming, when I'll feel like I have again enough material to post, I'll update it ASAP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">679alex</div><div class="date">01-29-2012, 04:06</div></div><div class="posttext">that look like so much Email creation&amp;validation :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">02-05-2012, 02:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, time for an update. These next two accounts (#3 and #4) took me a little bit longer and that's just because I took a little break in between (laziness). Nevertheless, account #4 is finished and account #3 is still botting at Al Dee's rats, that's just because botting at sewers is faster than botting at Al Dee's rats.<br />
<br />
On screenshot you can notice that the last couple of characters got less cash than usual. That's because today's 1,5 XP rate day and of course leveling was a bit faster which means less monsters were killed so less loot was looted. Simple.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope you'll have a great weekend, I certainly will. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">02-05-2012, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">cool! are you botting them all at once btw? also, how much ram do u got? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">02-05-2012, 23:20</div></div><div class="posttext">@Hans ... Well I bot one at Al Dee's rats and one at sewers regarding this project. Other than that, yes, I got 2 more clients running beside that, one's botting at Minotaurs Hell on Rookgaard and one at east side of Rookgaard hutning wolves and bears. So 4 clients at once, but not always. Botting on separate PC that's intented just to bot Tibia. It has 512 MB of RAM tho.<br />
<br />
Anyway, account #3 is finished :D:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">02-08-2012, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so, no screenshot regarding this project for today, but something else worth a 'lolz' :D. Decided to open a small Rookgaard project while doing those 1k chars of level 8. I've chosen Inferna, dunno why, always wanted to have a rookie there so after that it was time to pick a nickname, check out what I came up with (definately for the category of 'I cant belive it was accepted!'):<br />

<br />
Oh and OT: account #6 which was created on 04/02/2010 has only 5 chars left, that means it'll be finished tomorow! Yay! :D And that's only 1 account, what about the other one botting at Al Dee's rats?! Yeah, I'm doing 9-10 characters per day! :D That 1,5 XP thingy is really great, 24/7 till 15th of February.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">02-09-2012, 12:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Account #6 is finished, account #5 still bots at Al Dee's rats and of course new account already bots at sewers. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I've updated first post with statistics on 'current botting status' ... I'll update it everytime account gets finished! <br />
