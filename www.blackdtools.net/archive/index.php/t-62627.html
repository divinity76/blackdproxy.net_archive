	<meta name="description" content="So few days ago my friend instaled Avast on my cpu. Avast detected some virus in blackd files, but I found on forum, that this is some bug.  
Avast propably blocked something, and now I can log in to tibia only If I have blackd off.  
I tried reinstaling blackd, but that doesn't working. 
Any ideas? 
 
P.S. I already uninstaled avast, but that doesn't help." />
