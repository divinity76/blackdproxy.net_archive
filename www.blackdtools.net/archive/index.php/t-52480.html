4. Local appliances<br />
Local appliances can reduce DDOS with almost no loss to latency. However, this does not deal with exterior bottlenecks. Especially dynamic attacks can still be effective for up to 2 seconds before an appliance shields against these attacks.<br />
5. DDOS Mitigation Relays<br />
This can solve both internal and external problems. A contractor will charge CIP no more than $350 / month or so. The cost to CIP is player latency. I believe this latency can be kept to 50 milliseconds. Can players play with an increased ping of 50ms? This is one place where I need your help.<br />
<br />
Please post your current ping to the Tibia gameserver.<br />
<br />
Additionally, please give me suggestions on how to give average non-technical Tibians instruction on how to quickly measure and send me their Tibia server latency in ms. I don't know the gameserver IP, but I assume most the bot designers know how to do this.<br />
<br />
A combination of the above solutions may solve possibly the most destructive problem in Tibia.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they are more likely to Ban you than listening to you.</div></div><hr />
