If Mexico finishes second of our group, we get to play against Argentina. This is fact xD So we need to win against Uruguay, which we will (this is fact again). :D</div></div><hr />

The same corpse that you guys could only win 2-1? Not saying we will be in the final, probably wont even make it to the quarter-finals because our coach suck.<br />
<br />
Brazil has the best team overall, and favourites to win as always, but no reason to be so cocky because you are playing way below of what it is expected from such a team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">walla</div><div class="date">06-22-2010, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Germany is looking strong.<br />
<br />
Argentina, Brazil and Netherlands are definitely top contenders.<br />
<br />
As for Denmark, we got the talent to play up and beat all teams in the world, we just dont play the right players.<br />
<br />
We got a player who might be the biggest midfielder talent the world has ever seen, hes 18 years old.<br />
<br />
If he starts playing, Denmark will definitely go far, hes skill to speed up everything is impressive.</div></div><hr />

I never heard of him before the WC started, then a friend told me he's quite good. But calling him the biggest midfielder is too much in my eyes. Hope you're right, soccer nowadays has so few good players.<br />
<br />
@Robben My bad, didn't mean to be cocky or overconfident, was just exposing my thoughts. Can't disagree with you about Queiroz, such a retard =P. And the corpse only took 2-1 cause it kept defending itself, not like when it played Portugal. Else it would take a lot more...<br />
<br />
France was shameful not only today, Greece also could have gotten a little bit more far (Samaras in a good team can make a beautiful mess on others defences).<br />
Uruguay has a few good players, let's see after them win against SouthKorea. Argentina X Mexico is unknown, I wouldn't make a bet =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guy is called &quot;Christian Eriksen&quot;, he was bought by Ajax at the age of 16 and he is by far the biggest midfielder talent i've ever seen, he is 18 right now and when he peaks, he'll be one of the best to ever touch the ball.<br />
<br />
If  you get to watch a game with him you'll see, hes amazing.<br />
<br />
He was scouted back in 2005, so hes been scouting at a very young age.<br />

walla lol:p im from holland and i watch every game of ajax psv en feyenoord at tv and yes eriksen might be a big talent, but he will never be good enough to play at the top of the top, and when affelay was 18 and like labyad (hes 17) they are seen as bigger talents, just ask some of the dutch guys here, and infact ajax was weak signing him, because they always complain about big clubs taking their talents from them, and now they do the excact same!<br />
<br />
btw well see how good he is:p i guess he will get to play this thursday,and i hope to see some off him soon, btw if he gets the best player ever, ill eat my hat:&lt; i promisexD!</div></div><hr />

I am certain he'll be better than top of the top, hes immense ability to create speed and skill on the midfield is mindblowing at the age of 18(I might be over-exaggerating) but i do honestly think he'll be amazing when he peaks.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt be suprised if Barcelona buys him when he hits 20.</div></div><hr />

If that ball hit by Larson gone in things would be different (the one that hit the post). Would be the greatest goal so far in the WC, even more nice than Quagliarella earlier today.</div></div><hr />

3 people caused us to lose this game: Morten Olsen(Coach), Jon Dahl tomasson(Forward) and Thomas Sørensen(keeper)<br />
<br />
Daniel agger is sooo good, easily one of the best defensive players out there right now, and Eriksen is fucking amazing, if he had played more games wi th that ball i am sure the shot he fired off would've been a goal.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to see what happens next, denmark needs to change rutine for young talent now.</div></div><hr />

Then Argentina x Mexico. Argentina is clearly the favourite but Mexico can be a tough opponent...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I really think that Argentina should win, cos if Mexico wins, then we will have to play against Germany or England. Now, if Germany wins, then they will rip Mexico into pieces, if England wins, we will have a tight match. So theres a chance that Mexico doesnt last after quarter finals...<br />
<br />
Now, if Argentina wins, they will go against Germany or England, and Argentina is able to destoy and PK! both squads at the same time... So the dream goes on... Tbh all I want to see is the cup in hands of latin american hands ;D, and Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Uruguay and Brasil are our bets now :P</div></div><hr />

Sucks xD But anyways, since the start of the World Cup ive been cheering Argentina (I posted that before xD) so thers nothing lost yet... But if they lose against Germany Im gonna be sooo pissed off, cos as far as Ive seen, only Podolski and Klose shine on that squad, whereas Argentina has a lot if awesome players... And the UNBEATABLE Messi :D<br />
<br />
Edited: Btw, I didnt mention it but there were two beautiful goals this weekend and noone seems to talk about it, first one from Podolski against England, and the second one from Tevez. You know which goals we are talking about ;)</div></div><hr />

Netherlands playing Uruguay, on 6/7.<br />
<br />
I'm the BR here, so I gotta be honest:<br />
First half was ours, second was yours. You deserve the victory, but despite the winning/losing, it was a real great game. Two awesome teams playing against each other, unfortunately this time we lost.<br />
Hope you go ahead and win this shit, coz if you lose for Uruguay that'd so embarrasing.</div></div><hr />

Why dont they deserve to be in the semi-finals? Are you kidding me?<br />

Suarez got a red card for it, he got his punishment. Ghana is to blame for missing the penalty.<br />

You can't say that they dont deserve to be in the semi-finals because suarez intercepted the ball with his hand. He got punished and Ghana got a penalty which they shouldnt have missed</div></div><hr />

They couldn't. The sent off was in the last minute of the extra time. ROFL<br />
Yet, Ghana is the only to blame, actualy, Asamoah Gyan is the one to blame.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the fact is Holland is through and tomorrow we 'll watch a great game.<br />
I think Germany is going through, cause Spain can't play without attacking, so they'll lose in the counter-attacks :]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uruguay shouldn't be in the semi-finals cuz it was unsportive and unfair of them winning. Ghana missed, so that was their fault but they shouldn't needed to have a penalty in the first place they should have scored right there and then if suarez (not accidently) didn't intercepted the ball.<br />
<br />
Anyway... I hope we're gonna see a great game tomorrow, I hope and think Germany will win. Would be a great game in the finals. (back to '74 lolz )</div></div><hr />

Its part of the game. You put the hand on the ball like it happened and you get punished, Suarez got sent off and ghana got a penalty.<br />
<br />
At anytime time in the game any player can touch the ball with his hand, although he knows he will be punished right after.<br />
<br />
Suarez was just incredibly clever. There was nothing to loose at that time. If ghana had scored uruguay would be out of the world cup...</div></div><hr />

ye it was clever. But IMO Ghana should have just got the goal w/o the penalty, and what suarez did was just abusing and I don't like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, it wouldnt be football anymore if anyone just slapped his hand to the ball when the ball is almost in the goal<br />
<br />
Then we have over 20 years a waste char in the field to stick behind the keeper</div></div><hr />
