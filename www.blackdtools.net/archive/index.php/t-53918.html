Someone has a program which does this for you so use search<br />

*Chaos witht the alarms [found 2/ not enough options]<br />
You have a safelist too :S whats wrong with the alarms?<br />
<br />
<br />
*You have to load the Cavebot and Cheats separately<br />
 <br />
Yeah... why wouldn't we? Sometimes I want cheats, sometimes I want cave botting...<br />
<br />
*Can't set which Item to use where  [or haven't found yet]<br />
