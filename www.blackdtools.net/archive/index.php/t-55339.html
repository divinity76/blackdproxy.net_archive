I'll consider this thread only a &quot;public warning&quot; with the &quot;best of the intention&quot; by both of you.<br />
<br />
Not defending anyone, but that's the way things roll here.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
No offence to you, but if you read everything you can easly see that they no where demands any ban just telling peoples to be cautious..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">05-16-2011, 20:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol man, I never said they're claiming for bans nor said I'd ban anyone.<br />
<br />
I've already banned ppl who claimed they have been scammed and they actually scammed the other guy. They tried to &quot;yell first&quot;. <br />
Idk if you get my point by saying this warning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hultin</div><div class="date">09-18-2011, 14:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the shameless bump, but I'd like to make it clear that I only wanted to warn people, I've got nothing to prove he's a scammer and he's not acctually tried to scam me. This was just a public warning to be careful with him, with that said he might be a 100% legit guy.</div></div><hr />
