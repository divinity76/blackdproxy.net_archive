Well I'm not sure what you're trying to say, but of course you'll 'poof' if there's not enough mana, therefore you won't be able to heal ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Only exura, If Mana, And IF hp below, tt.. Etc?<br />
<br />
According to quoted section I made something that might help you, I'm still not sure if I understood you right, so just post back and explain a bit what you're trying to do.<br />
<br />
Anyway:<br />
<br />
<br />
$myhp$<br />
#number&lt;#<br />
XXX<br />
0<br />
250<br />
0<br />
exura<br />
$mymana$<br />
#number&gt;#<br />
XXX<br />
0<br />
250<br />
0<br />
exura<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
XXX = if your HP drops under this amount, bot will cast exura.<br />
<br />
XXX = if your MANA is above this amount, bot will cast exura. (preventing mana from being full)<br />
<br />
Like I said,  just post back if you were thinking about completely other thing.</div></div><hr />
