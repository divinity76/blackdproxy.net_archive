Seems like BlackD Proxy is highly detectable, not even a simple script, like walking around cave killing monsters (without looting), MUST NOT be used unless you want your account deleted at the very next ban wave. 
 
Do you have any clue why BlackD Proxy is so highly detectable at the moment? :(" />

The only solution would be to build new bot from scratch, slowly and carefully.<br />
You can use Blackd Safe Cheats as base. That it is not detectable yet. Just start adding few things and check if test accounts remain undeleted in next ban wave, then keep adding few things. That would be a nice project. I don't have time for it nowadays, but the code is there for any person who wants to give it a try.</div></div><hr />

I'm already testing few things out right now until the next ban wave. :) Thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />
