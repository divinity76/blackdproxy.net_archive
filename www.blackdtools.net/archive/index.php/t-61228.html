	<meta name="description" content="Hello, 
First of all I want to say that yes,  I know the basic procedure of getting blackd to work at ots. 
I'm playing at 10.10 OTS and have two machines - one with XP and one with Windows 7. 
The XP one works with OTS without any problem but at Win7 bot doesn't recognize when I start tibia via ip changer. 
The procedure I'm using - set bot config to 10.10 ots, type in ots adress, make sure it is set to forward to ots with correct adress/port, close bot, start tibia via ip changer, start bot -" />

I made sure that bot is working at all, at rl tibia (cipsoft servers) it's all good. <br />
Any idea what is going wrong and why? I really need solution to this.<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
