Really, how come better games like wow got alot of undetected bots, in a company that worths millions of dollars and they also spend thousand of dollars on anti cheating measures, and they are beaten anyways, and here we are fucked up by this pathethic automatic detection tool, really man its crap, i think if people stops buying bots, and they see they are loosing customers, they would start to find a real solution on this; after all this bot was made to make money right? or do you think its pure carity act lmao, all of this is about money seriously, no offense daniel, no offense to all this nice community, because after all, i think blackd, magebot and tug are the bests bots, with a nice and warm community.<br />
<br />
ps. i know this is not a easy job, but seriously Daniel, if you really put a litle more interest on this insteed of searching other ways to make money like the powerlevel service, this would be solved already.<br />
ps. im  just giving my point of view on this matter etc, this works this way, if you keep buying they are happy they wont be doing nothing until they really see their business is in danger. Its like a crisis, if you are ok, you dont do nothing at all, but if you are in a crisis you do all the shits possibles to solve it lol.</div></div><hr />

I hear you, but the biggest problem is we dont know what is detecting us, there are theories but its not 100%, in WoW everyone who needed to know, knew, down to the very hour they scan because WoW has a HUGE community of programmers its more easily found out and spread unlike tibia where the names of programmers have slowly been dropping (altho thats not to say there arent any new comers that have talent)<br />

First of all, daniel is getting an education on the sideline, and do you honestly think hes making cash of this right now? nobody is buying bots nowadays and i honestly think that what daniel is doing is amazing, you have no idea how many internal test he has to do to make sure everything is safe, you should be glad hes even bothered working for this lost cause anymore.<br />
<br />
Hands down, daniel is and will always remain the finest bot programmer.<br />

Im not blaming Daniel, i know hes the finest bot programmer this website its the one i like the most for tibia cheats, but seriously take a look of what is he doing, searching another payment methods like mooneybookers, hes doing business of power leveling lvl 50 chars, etc, have you seen any other update for bdsafe cheat than the new version support? and im pretty sure you dont know a s.. what he does do in rl lmao.<br />
