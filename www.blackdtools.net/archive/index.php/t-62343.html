If you would be interested in taking on such a venture, im sure i could think of a considerable compensation. 
 
even if the script could contain botting areas, until you reach a certain level, then take on specific quests etc. It would truly be a sight to see.

Anyone think they have the skill/time to attempt something like this?<br />

Ive been using bdt for a few years now, and i have been compiling scripts to run around venore and thais. The problem i find, is that there is so much to do in each town, one would have to think that the world of tibia and its contents would have to be subsidized into specific scripts. one for each town.</div></div><hr />
