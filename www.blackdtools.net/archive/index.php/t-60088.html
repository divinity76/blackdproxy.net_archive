Today, 2549 Tibia accounts have been excluded from<br />
the game for using unofficial software to play during<br />
the last couple of weeks. These accounts have been<br />
identified by our automatic tool. For this reason,<br />
complaints about these punishments are in vain.<br />
<br />
<br />
February 27, 2013:<br />
<br />
<br />
5390 Tibia accounts have been detected using<br />
unofficial software to play during the last couple of<br />
weeks. These accounts have been deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
(now they don't say that they have been identified by an automatic tool, because around 50% were detected by human CMs)</div></div><hr />
