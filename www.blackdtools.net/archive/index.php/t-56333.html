	<meta name="description" content="Hi, i wanted to make a new script with depositer for Tombs. Unfortunately i don't know how to make my bot to using shovel on place where should be hole. Because one time this whole is opend after 4 click's but anothertime I have to click 10 time's. It's possible to write something to using shovel as much times as it's needed or I should add to this script 15 time's with shovel and wish luck that everything will work? 
Thanks for yours anserws ; )" />

I couldn't find it in internet ;/</div></div><hr />

Basically, just check the &quot;log packets&quot;, use shovel on the spot (use with hotkey or you will need to have the shovel at the same/bp spot for it to work next time), uncheck &quot;log packets&quot; and search for a packet sent by GAMECLIENT1 as on the picture.<br />

Take the red part and use &quot;exiva &gt; 82 ...........&quot; etc.</div></div><hr />
