	<meta name="description" content="I've made a script for west Venore rotworms and started botting there. I realised that bot sometimes skips through waypoints or randomly stops saying &quot;There is no way&quot; and then finds the track, but sometimes just stands in one place forever. I don't know why it does so. It is really annoying because I keep have to check if the bot is stuck and I can't do much while I'm botting, also can't leave it full afk. Is there any simple solution for this or it needs to be fixed in the source code?" />
