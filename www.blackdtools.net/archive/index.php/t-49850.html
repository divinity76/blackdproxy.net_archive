I would stay stick with Royals because Yes arrows are cheaper and you can make them but in the long run with the potions waste from getting hurt with bows then the shield and spear is the way to go</div></div><hr />

check the calculator at tibia-stats.com. according to it royal xbow has best dmg/gold ratio.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a very narrow-minded way of viewing the matter.<br />
<br />
Yes it has higher average damage but barely.  Onyx arrows and warsinger are just slightly behind royal, around 6-9 per hit.  However, this is evened out a bit due to creature healing.  There are many times when you are just about to kill a creature, but miss that final shot and the creature heals.  Then it ends up taking three extra hits instead of the initial one. Warsinger on the other hand almost never misses, so these cases are reduced quite a lot.  Granted, this alone probably isn't enough to even it out, however, it's important to keep in mind that the averages do not tell the whole story.<br />
<br />
But that's only one small part of the advantage. Next, you have to consider exp/hr.  Most people tend to think that since you do more damage, you will have greater exp/hr.  Well, this isn't entirely true in the long-run due to external factors.  Anybody who's played a pally to a decent level knows that a huge limiting factor on hunts is their capacity.  Going back and forth between town during long hunts takes up a lot of time and can drastically decrease your exp/hr.  Onyx arrows only weigh .7 oz. as opposed to the .9 that power bolts weigh.  This means that every 1000 oz worth of power bolts could of actually been an extra 318 shots!  And warsinger bow weighs 75 oz. less just by itself, so that's an extra 100 shots every hunt regardless of your max capacity.<br />
<br />
Now I know the typical counter-argument already, &quot;I could just lootbag bolts.&quot;  Well sure you could, but that's just taking up more time once again.  If you already happen to lootbag, then obviously the weight advantage won't help you.  However, it's very unlikely that many people do this for every hunt, as there are just some places/times in which this is just a pain and not worth it.<br />
<br />
Also, warsinger has a further range and once you hit around 90 distance or so (not sure exactly when), it no longer makes a difference for accuracy: it is always 99%.  This means that given enough room, you can always stay out of range of area spells like DL's fire wave and demon's GFB, and I think even hit off-screen opponents.  This ends up saving even more on healing in the long-run.<br />
<br />
So the barely-less-damage, in my opinion, more than makes up for it in every category.</div></div><hr />

basic flaw in ur entire post is that the hit% is firstly never at 99%, no matter what skills, the highest it can get is 93% or something around that and 2. is the hit% already included into the dmg/gold ratio in that calculator.-&gt; its taking into account already the fact u might miss more often with xbow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajax thunderblade</div><div class="date">04-20-2010, 16:23</div></div><div class="posttext">96% is the highest anyone can attain, so said tibia-stats at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, 93% being the highest is just wrong.  Get your facts straight.<br />
<br />
Secondly, did you even pay attention to what I wrote?  Nowhere did I at all say that the dmg/gold ratio isn't in the calculator, what I said was that the calculator cannot account for the cases where the final hit misses, which makes more of a difference than other any other case.  Normally you just reshoot and it takes away one turn, but if it's the final hit then it sets you back 3 turns since the creature would of already been dead otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
96% is the highest anyone can attain, so said tibia-stats at least.<br />
<br />
No, that's not what it says at all.  What it says is that 96% is the highest unaltered value you can attain.<br />
<br />
P-bolt: 91% + 3% royal = 94<br />
Onyx Arrow: 94%  + 5% warsinger = 99<br />
A-star: 96%<br />
<br />
And no, the values aren't calculated independently like resistances, hit % is added together directly before any other calculations.</div></div><hr />
