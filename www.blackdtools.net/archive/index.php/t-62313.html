Nowdays OT servers version 7.4 have became very popular. And because of that the bug fixes that were made in upper versions by cipsoft are not implemented. Of course some owners of OT have got big knowledge what do they have to fix but sometimes they forgot to do that and some another owners dont have clue at all. 
 
I want to make list of known bugs that we could share with each other and exploit them in the game. I can give few examples of bugs that are known to me.

I want to make list of known bugs that we could share with each other and exploit them in the game. I can give few examples of bugs that are known to me.<br />
1. Uhtraps - if few people on same spot only the person on the top is able to heal himself.<br />
2. Poh trap - you can lure many gses to the pitfal that is located in the middle of poh. And if some player enter that cave he dies instantly<br />
3. Item &quot;Trap&quot; is bugged in many servers and you can stack many opened traps on one SQM. If you put 100 traps on one sqm it makes dmg 100*~20 = 2k. So you can easy hunt dragon lords with that. If you just hit DL once and traps will finnish him you will get entire expedience for him.<br />
4Elevator in kazzordoon. You can put energy field on bottom elevator sqm and if somebody will stand on the top sqm you have to continual push leaver as fast as you can. He wont be able to do anything. He will just stuck and he will recive damage</div></div><hr />
