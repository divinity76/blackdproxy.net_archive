<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">09-19-2012, 20:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there Shannon, im pretty new myself Ive been around for a few years but never really posted myself. Now that I have got a little insight on the program BlackD I have a little more confidence in helping other people out. There is two things I found most important with BlackD and first and foremost is learning how to write your own scripts, I found no matter what when I used public scripts I eventually got a ban, but whenever I used my own scripts no matter how long straight I never got the ban because they were my own waypoints. Second of all, never use BlackD (CAVEBOT) on your main account if you do not want to recieve the ban, botting should be saved for free accounts that you do not care about to farm some extra GP while you sleep persay, but using Auto-Heal and Auto-Drink Manas from the Conditional Events within BlackD Tools is perfectly fine as far as Ive seen, on another note I have also used Trainer function on my main account as well, because I am too damn lazy to put another 100 stones in my hand every so often. There is many functions that BlackD has that you are unaware of, browse the forum and you should find all your answers! I hope this helped,<br />
