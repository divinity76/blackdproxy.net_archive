We started with 3 members, lost 1, and now we have people off and on helping. Because of this TeamSurge has been broken up into 2 sub teams. SurgeX and BloodMoney, SurgeX will be working on the features part of the script. BloodMoney will be dropping waypoints into the script from time2time.<br />
would really like to have players from AB,carlin,venrore join the team. Could use the help and would give in return<br />

#================================================= <br />
section<br />
1<br />
#=== here we will answer, what exactly is Surge and what can it do?<br />
<br />
Surge is now a single control script that is needed to allow features that could <br />
<br />
not be done with simple variables alone. Surge is designed with fully AFK <br />
<br />
ServerSave-&gt;ServerSave in mind, with the exception of kicks or PK. The Script <br />
<br />
has advanced options and all the basic functionality as other scripts but these <br />
<br />
functions have been improved on in big ways.<br />
Surge can be used on its own through rook but will not go to main without <br />
<br />
Bloodmoney's WayPoints.{see:.post 3} <br />
<br />
#================================================= <br />
section<br />
2<br />
#=== Welcome to the how to section here I will provide links to tutorials or <br />
<br />
present them<br />
<br />
<br />
#================================================= <br />
section<br />
3<br />
#=== Basic settings:<br />
fastExiva _world = World          <br />
the custom variable _world tells Surge the name of the world you are playing <br />
<br />
on. this is important because if you play more then one world Surge has to know <br />
<br />
to only team with chars in the same world. if you play the same world on all <br />
<br />
accounts you still need to set this because your bot will use this information <br />
<br />
to gather more information and if you have the _speak variable ON it needs to <br />
<br />
know what world your on. <br />
fastExiva _ServerSave = 3:00<br />
what is the exact time of Server Save? this is so that the bot will go <br />
<br />
someplace safe 15min before SS<br />
#================================================= <br />
section<br />
4<br />
#=== Char &amp; Outfit settings:<br />
fastExiva _vocation = knight<br />
Set the vocation you want to be. if you already have a vocation other then this <br />
<br />
it will be bypassed with _voc. Rookers have no vocation so if you are in rook <br />
<br />
you are treated as a knight by default.<br />
*accepted input(Knight,Paladin,Druid,Sorcerer) premotions are not accepted to <br />
<br />
prevent using scripts on premmy accounts.<br />
fastExiva _weapon = sword<br />
Set the weapon type you want as your main weapon. if you are not a knight this <br />
<br />
sets your secondary weapon type. most if not all of rook will use this type.<br />
*accepted input(sword,axe,club,fist) if using fist set _ironman = 5 or more just <br />
<br />
to be safe<br />
fastExiva _city = thais<br />
city in main you want to be a citizen of and hunt at. Surge can walk you to <br />
<br />
other cities and make you a citizen of them <br />
*accepted input(thais,carlin,abdendriel,venore,kazordoon)<br />
#------------------------<br />
These settings will change your chars outfit when first starting in rook(<br />
<br />
see Color Chart bellow)<br />
fastExiva _class = auto<br />
fastExiva _Head = 72<br />
fastExiva _Primary = 72<br />
fastExiva _Secondary = 72<br />
fastExiva _Detail = 72<br />
{COLOR CHART}7897<br />
NOTE: REMEMBER TO USE CAPITOL LETTERS(the chart uses lowercase just because <br />
<br />
&quot;that's what i did&quot;)<br />
#================================================= <br />
section<br />
5<br />
#=== advanced settings:<br />
fastExiva _PowerSurge = 0 focus on EXP <br />
<br />
vs. loot<br />
sets loot off if the char has 200+gp. makes decisions based off of expgain<br />
1=on,0=off,2=auto<br />
fastExiva _IronMan = 0 adjust lvl <br />
<br />
requirement by # lvls<br />
basically a handicap. say your bots keep dieing from rats, if u tell the bot it <br />
<br />
needs to be +1 lvl to hunt rats then you might last longer in caves.(not the <br />
<br />
fastest exp)<br />
0=off,1=+1 lvl(1-99, I wouldn't set it past 20)<br />
fastExiva _TeamPlayer = 0<br />
soon your bots will be able to cummunicate with eachother. this feature will <br />
<br />
allow this; say you have 2 bots running at the same time. your bots will tell <br />
<br />
eachother were they plan on hunting so that there not both hunting the same <br />
<br />
place, or if a bot is getting way more exp then expected other bot will join the <br />
<br />
first bot. if a bot is getting lower then expected exp then bot will notify the <br />
<br />
first bot and depending on the situation may ask the second to join him or find <br />
<br />
a lower lvl hunting spot.<br />
1=on,0=off,2=auto<br />
#================================================= <br />
section<br />
6<br />
#=== Rook  settings:<br />
fastExiva _Rooker = 0 stay in rook<br />
<br />
<br />
pretty simple, if this feature is on then bot will not go to main and will <br />
<br />
continue as a rooker. If this setting is on there will be a warning comment <br />
<br />
every 2 min for the first and last lvl in rook.<br />
0=off,1=on<br />
fastExiva _logatlvl = 99 lvl that bot <br />
<br />
will log-out if still in rook.if _Rooker = 1 will bypass this<br />
this is the lvl that your bot will log out at. basicaly only used if you want to <br />
<br />
logout befor leaving rook but can be used in main just the same. just set the <br />
<br />
lvl you wish to logout at(rookB4main=9)<br />
Note:Remember that if _Rooker is set on then this will have no effect until lvl <br />
<br />
99 unless changed.<br />
#================================================= <br />
section<br />
7<br />
#=== Loot settings<br />
fastExiva _lootsemirare = 1 on by <br />
<br />
default<br />
on by default however; if bot is getting errors because of this then it can be <br />
<br />
shut off<br />
fastExiva _lootrare = 1 on by default<br />
<br />
<br />
same as semirare, on by default<br />
fastExiva _gathering = 0 needs a cool <br />
<br />
name(gathers items to be dropped in a pile)<br />
looking for better name for this feature. what it does is simple it gathers <br />
<br />
items that are not used by its vocation and drops them in a predecided location<br />
<br />
(spears,arrows,bolts)<br />
you can then tell other bots to go get them, take to dp or use, if anything just <br />
<br />
leave them for someone else. off by default to save time<br />
0=off,1=on,2=auto<br />
#================================================= <br />
section<br />
8<br />
#=== custom variables (special)<br />
Here we will identify all of the variables that Surge will recognize.<br />
<br />
_var IN conds:<br />
_conditionals = 1 - this tells the script that the conds have been loaded<br />
$_hasSpell*****$ - tells if learned spell *****<br />
_healvar - 1of2 conds to heal<br />
_HpotVar - 1of2 conds to heal pot<br />
_HruneVar - 1of2 conds to heal rune<br />
_ManapotVar - 1of2 conds to mana pot<br />
_APoxVar - 1of2 conds to exana pox<br />
$_healspell$ - heal spell defined by surge<br />
$_wastespell$ - spell to use when mana is full<br />
<br />
dev _var Cond:<br />
$_oldlevel$ - mylvl recorded earlier<br />
<br />
dev _var Code:<br />
<br />

#=== Q&amp;A/CAQ<br />
As this project moves forward we expect questions, so here you can check if we <br />
<br />
already have an answer.<br />
<br />
Q: is this bot full afk?<br />
A: Surge is intended to be 99% AFK, 1%=14.4min and is needed to buy EQ,brown <br />
<br />
mushrooms,other market items.<br />
   An exception to this is when there is a kick from server.<br />
<br />
Q: were does it hunt?<br />
A: Surge W/ BloodMoney hunts in many diffrent places. Surge will redirect you to <br />
<br />
a new hunting ground every 5 or less Levels.<br />
<br />
Q:<br />

<br />
<br />
In a nutshell BloodMoney WPs are just there to tell the bot were it needs to go. surge on its own would be to big ATM with all cities and hunting spots packed in it. so for now these WPs will be copy and pasted into surge manually.<br />
at the time of the second version of surge there will be preconfigured scripts for the cities up for DL<br />
<br />
<br />
BMThais<br />
BloodMoney Thais is the first of the BM scripts because it is arguably the most used city. <br />
<br />
Places bot will go in Thais:<br />
7907<br />
DP<br />
DP bank<br />
DP post office<br />
Lower level DP chests<br />
magic shop<br />
wep/arm shop<br />
general supplies shop<br />
vocation spell shops<br />
axe quest<br />
<br />
BMBakerThais<br />
BM Baker is just a fun script that will make tons of cookies,cakes,or bread. when there is no wheat bot will go to DP and logout<br />
When wheat is cut it grows back in a two real-time days (after two server-saves).<br />
Places bot will go in Thais:<br />
wheat field<br />
flour mill<br />
water well<br />
ovens<br />
DP chests lower levels</div></div><hr />
