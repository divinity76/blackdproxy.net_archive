Are you using latest version of Blackd Proxy? (26.4)<br />
Are you playing OT server?<br />
<br />
if you are playing real tibia and you are using 26.4 and you still have the bug then please email me with the name of the char that is giving you problems. then I will do tests with that name to search the problem.<br />
<br />
my email: daniel@blackdtools.com</div></div><hr />
