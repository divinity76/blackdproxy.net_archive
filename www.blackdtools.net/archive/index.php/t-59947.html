 I don't mind contacting them and I know that in general that will be a lot safer and easier, but some (or many) of the scripts I've looked at are salvageable just old and if I were to try to get in touch with the author and he/she hasn't been seen for 3 years it's somewhat doubtful I will ever be able to make any such contact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would definitely recommend making a list of 'safe scripts' (no exiva &gt;&gt; or other things that are most likely detectable). I myself am thinking of doing a list like this for Knights but making all the scripts people request myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice to see people joining this project! I can help too!<br />
We should make some sort of script standards/guidelines/rules for people that create scripts for this list to follow. For example, 'No exiva &gt; commands' or 'Use lootAll = 1', etc..<br />
This way all scripts are 'safe' :D</div></div><hr />
