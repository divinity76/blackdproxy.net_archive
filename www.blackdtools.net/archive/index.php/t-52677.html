About the drinks - in my opinion there will be some of them for free (like coke), but others you must buy by yourself (tea/coffe). By the way: how much does a ticket cost?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
well usual coke and tea/coffee is free and beer cost money? but ticket from holland event bus to there is 100&#8364; and ticket to dreamhack is 80&#8364; so its kinda cheap for me :p</div></div><hr />

There are some Cola zero in like 0,15 liter containers (15cl) that some hot ass chicks give out for free :DDDD <br />
Anyway, the 14 year old children that are there just to hang with girls/boys are annoying as hell. They arent there for gaming..<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the leaders of the event are kinda childish.. kinda hard to explain.. <br />
Important:, always have a friend/neigbor to watch your stuff while you're away. You never know if the stuff is still there when you come back after you left.. (That suxs hard)<br />
<br />
They're celebrating their 10th anneversity (spelling?) this winter also. (I think) so I think it will be kinda awesome.<br />
<br />
ONE last thing :P ehm. Bring along alot of CASH. Join the IRC and then buy stolen stuff or other things VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY!!!! Cheap :P<br />
<br />
Too bad I didnt have it when I was there :&lt;<br />
<br />
Good luck! :DD</div></div><hr />

I surely want to, but I don't know yet. I don't have the cash right now and I also need friends to go with. Train is VERY expensive &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />
