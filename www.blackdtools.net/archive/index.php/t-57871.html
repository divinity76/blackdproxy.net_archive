	<meta name="description" content="Hello, I´m trying to make good lootbag scripts for dwarf guards. 
I want to use the &quot;drop loot on x sqm&quot; just to have the loot kind of organized for me. 
 
So I figured that if it was possible to make &quot;Drop bags with +something oz on x sqm&quot; and just bring alot of bags in your backpack. And fill up the epmty spots in your bp so it loots in the bags. 
Then it would be just a lot of bags on the x sqm full of items easy to organize. 
 
thanks in advance!" />
