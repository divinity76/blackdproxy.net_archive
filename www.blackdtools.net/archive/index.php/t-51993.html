I bought 2,2kk gold on Titania using my paypal account on August 8, 2010. I needed the cash within 2 DAYS!. I bought it and did not receive any GOLD(and still havent).  
 
Aug 8, 2010	Payment To	Piotr XXXXX Completed	-$154.00	$0.00	-$154.00 USD 
 
When I saw on the 2nd day that I didnt receive money, I had to buy money from Messixx(I recommend him) because I needed to buy an item asap before it was getting sold to another person.

Almost 3 days has past and I already bought money from someone else, I decided to email Neo-Gold and opening a dispute using Paypal that I no longer need the cash and that I'd like my money back and not that I have not received any gold on titania still so the chargeback was not a problem.Later that day August 11, I get an email from Peter(Kapucha90@wp.pl, it is listed on Neo-Gold.com) saying...<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
 <br />
thanks for patience we had some problems with interenet connection.<br />
 <br />
You didn't sent us ur name in game so weren't able to send goods.<br />
 <br />
Please decide what we are doing, give you back money or complete it in <br />
normal way.<br />
 <br />
Kind regards,<br />
Peter neo-gold.com<br />

<br />
I'm like perfect. I sent an email quickly after saying I would like my cash back instead of getting gold on the server. <br />
<br />
I have been waiting for 8 days now(August 8-August 16) and STILL HAVEN'T NOT GOT MY CASH BACK.<br />
<br />
I have been looking at their supported thread and it shows that people aren't getting their gold either. I'd be careful buying from these guys.</div></div><hr />
