	<meta name="description" content="People, I need help. Blackd has stuck out of nowhere, no matter if I turn on the cavebot or just let my maker run. Passes 1 to 2 minutes and the char frezzes, does not log, walks only a sqm to the side and does not move anymore. When this happens I need to close the client, open another mc and log in to the char again. 
 
I went with another char near the one that caught him and he keeps logged in and stopped. 
 
Do you have any idea what might be happening? 
 
Thanks for the help!" />
