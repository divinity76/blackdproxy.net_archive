So far I only got 1 report of 1 person that said he got ban with blackd proxy cavebot in last ban wave at Tibia 9.00.  
HOWEVER, he was a new user in this forum (post count=1), and he didn't seem to have any blackd proxy license, at least not in his registered email. I asked him for his license email and he ignored me. No answer after a week, so I deleted his post. I think that was probably a fake report. How" />

How could he get a ban with blackd proxy if he doesn't have a blackd proxy license??</div></div><hr />

<br />
but blackd proxy needs serious work at the moment, the cavebot walks around and around the target like it mapclicks where the creature was to get to it rather than just walking to the creature</div></div><hr />

My main char is clean, but I did not use a cavebot on it... Just another functions of blackd proxy like: runemaker, warbot, conds, events. Also my noob characters on rock &amp; main are clean (using my own cavebot scripts updated every new version of tibia client) So: 4 chars are clean. No bans/warn.</div></div><hr />

Gotta agree. Last time I tried to bot it was a bit sad :S</div></div><hr />

Its normal thats botting :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-21-2012, 19:59</div></div><div class="posttext">right, this was an old thread.<br />
anyways this kind of open questions is not really usefull because most people still does not understand that if they were already marked to be deleted then the will be deleted anyways.<br />
I should only consider reports from people who created account and used cavebot with latest version.<br />
Closing this thread.</div></div><hr />
