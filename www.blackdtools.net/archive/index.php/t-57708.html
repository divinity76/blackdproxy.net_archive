<br />
It has no depositer/refiller as I dont need one and dont have the time to test it thoroughly.<br />
<br />
But the script works perfectly.<br />
<br />
I getaround 30k/hour of exp and like 6k/hour of cash, with like 2k waste on pots on a lvl 62 knight with 2H weapon.<br />
It starts coming down the stairs on the magician's side<br />

<br />
Sure... my two handed weapon has 45 atk, so a weapon with atk 44, is good too.<br />
A lvl 52 will surely make profit here on magicians. Skills could be improved, but it is perfectly possible to make profit. Altho I would remove the fight against priestess, but that's up to you.<br />
<br />
Im currently making a script for mutated humans, you might want to check that later on. Tell me if you know a better spot to hunt. I want to make a chakoya or dworc script, but I dont know where they are, and I dont have much free time(the main reason Im botting). But I would like to help you out.</div></div><hr />
