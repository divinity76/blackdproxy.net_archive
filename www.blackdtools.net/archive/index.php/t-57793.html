<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">04-15-2012, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">If the account/character gets detected it's deleted forever. @BlackD said it many times, cavebot isn't safe function yet, because we don't know what is detectable and what not.  If you don't care about your premium you can bot it up all the way, but it's still quite a risk in doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-15-2012, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Cipsoft only do deletions by account nowadays, so all your chars in that account will be lost in case any char is detected.<br />
<br />
Solution: make 1 account per char. And only register real personal information in the main char accounts (you should not us cavebot there) Register fake random information in the cavebot accounts and your main chars will remain safe.</div></div><hr />
