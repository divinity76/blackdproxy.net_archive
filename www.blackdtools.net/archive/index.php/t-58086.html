We want to support this new digital currency, and we wish to see a great success there. 
 
For people who don't know about bitcoins, you can read more here:

You need to download the main program there to build your wallet. That is a pocket that will hold your digital coins that you will earn later. 
How you get coins? There are several ways, but for me the best way is running a mining program in background:" />

If you are going to do mining then it is strongly recommended to join a mining team. I recommend this one, the biggest one at this moment:<br />
http://deepbit.net/<br />
&quot;bitcoins mining&quot; does not disturb with you stupid ads. Nothing bad except some extra cpu/gpu usage. It only do maths in the background and you get payed for it!<br />
A very easy way to get free tibia gold for you. Having your computer mining in background for 1 week will usually get you enough bitcoins to buy 10.000 gold. (or a lot more if you have a good cpu/graphic card)<br />
<br />
I have added bitcoins to payment options in my tibia gold shop. Check it at https://blackdtools.net/tibiagold.php</div></div><hr />
