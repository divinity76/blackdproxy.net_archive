	<meta name="description" content="Hello guys, Im gonna start playing Fiesta Online, and I will be playing a Trickster. 
 
Now, Build Guides says there are different builds, and I want to focus on a 33 DEX/ Rest STR, but my question is as follows: 
 
Should I first get the 33DEX, then the STR?? Or should I add 1 DEX, then 1 STR, untill 33 DEX are reached, so then I focus on putting everything on STR?? 
 
Thanks in advance." />

¿ <br />
When you level up, you are given a Skill Point, that you can add to STR, STR, DEX, END, etc... So basically in Tibian speak: Immagine that when you leveled up you were given a Skill Point that you could add to Shielding, or Sword, or Axe, Fishing, Mlvl, etc. Your call.<br />
<br />
So thats the meaning xD</div></div><hr />
