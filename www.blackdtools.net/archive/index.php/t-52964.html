As it turned out that gallar is a scamer and I was rightful, and unfairly banished even through I lost 240&#8364;, I would like to say that it would be nice if people would at least help me NOW because Iboltzer is accusing me to be a scamer because I got earlier banned on Timtrade but that was not for scaming but for accusing without a valid proof.<br />
<br />
I would like to see some moderator take care of this issue and dont let someone accuse me for scaming without any valid proof.<br />
<br />
That would be very nice.<br />
Thanks in advance, <br />
<br />
