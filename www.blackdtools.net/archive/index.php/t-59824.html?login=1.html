	<meta name="description" content="We noticed that some deleted accounts today were using cavebot scripts containing exiva buy / sell 
They can be dangerous commands, specially if you try to sell ZERO items. Client would never send such packets.  
 
From now - since Blackd Proxy 27.6 - bot will not send any trade packet to server if the amount is zero. That is why I say bot is now a bit safer. 
 
Anyways it have been proven that the people using very basic cavebot scripts were not detected. If you want to be as safe as possible" />
