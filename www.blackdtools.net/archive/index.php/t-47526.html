NOTE: You can't turn of the function &quot;Small trees&quot; because it writes in your Tibiamemory and therebefore you cant get it back. Just restart your Tibia client and Machbot and it will be back to normal. <br />

Please comment and rate it! New idéas would be very nice aswell. But I aint planning to make this to a &quot;big&quot; cheat in the future. <br />

Yeah, I just uploaded it, so you maybe need to wait a little :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I don't know what've happened. As I speak I'm re-uploading the video again.<br />
<br />
And I don't know if the bot is safe for the auto-detection tool, but if you ment &quot;safe&quot; with &quot;safe&quot; (hack). Yes, It's safe. But any hacker can say that, so that doesn't really answer your question.. But I say yes because I made it lol :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, thank you for your kind words. I understand you. I honesly hate &quot;building&quot; something when someone else &quot;built&quot; the pieces for me. You know what I mean?<br />
<br />
And too bad I work with C# and now vb :( Thank you anyway! &lt;3</div></div><hr />

But start with a small cheat and send own packets with packet.dll in the begginging. Then you can realy easy make a autohealer, or a spellcaster. Learn battlelist and make the first step of lighthack etc etc. Realy fun when those part fall into the head :) Gl with your programming skillzz<br />

            client.Memory.WriteBytes(Addresses.Map.FullLightNo p, Addresses.Map.FullLightNopEdited)<br />
            client.Memory.WriteByte(Addresses.Map.FullLightAdr , Addresses.Map.FullLightAdrEdited)<br />
        End Sub<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the maphackLight hack I've use in my project, the code is only converted from tibiaapi. So my tip is take some parts of tibiaApi source and build it to your own :)</div></div><hr />

Also I'm very new to TibiaAPI, and I've never opened a DLL in any compiler/scripter before... How do I go about it? Assuming I need an addon?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wrote it in C# and used Visual Studio 2008. When you download the TibiaAPI you will get a .txt telling you how to import it to your project. I would have given you the source code for my program if I hadn't reformated my disk by mistake lol -.-<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck and have fun!<br />

Note it's quite faaaar from done ^^ Atleast with the layout lol :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not have a listbox or a combobox if you really need this?<br />
<br />
Whats your goal in this project? Have a tool so you can be 100% akf or a tool you use when u hunt/war?<br />
 <br />
And how do you send packets? By memory or the injected dll or the proxy?<br />
<br />
Things like is good to know:)</div></div><hr />
