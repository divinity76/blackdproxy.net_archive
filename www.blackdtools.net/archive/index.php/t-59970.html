But that was like 4 or 5 years ago lol, before they implemented an exhaust for such movements :P<br />
<br />
Man, I loved exiva hex, it allowed the bot to do anything, heard it got disabled because of auto-ban in recent versions.</div></div><hr />

So technically you can still trash depots</div></div><hr />
