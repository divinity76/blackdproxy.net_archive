I KNOW I have asked a lot but I would appreciate any and all help :D<br />

Lootdropping you do like this<br />
<br />
move x,y,z<br />
resetLoot<br />
#Loot to drop, don't remember IDs<br />
setLoot sword<br />
setLoot mace<br />
dropLootOnGround x,y,z<br />
#Set loot not dropped, gold dirt and fangs<br />
setLoot D7 0B<br />
setLoot DC 25<br />
setLoot 23 28<br />
<br />
Just edit the x,y,z to the pos you want it to drop on.<br />
<br />
Also it will always loot everything into every open backpakc you have, it will not discimrinate between loot nor open new backpacks. So best have several open. But don't minimize them... Dropping loot into minimized backpacks could be considered pretty... fishy.</div></div><hr />
