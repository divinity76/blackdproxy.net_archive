<br />
I already know that some bots(only packet bots?) can use a technique of framerate reducing while minimized, maybe you can tell a little more about how it works.<br />
I was also told that my video card also plays a important role on my MCing computer performance, maybe you can tell me how important it is.<br />
<br />
Any knowledge on this topic will help me considering which bot's to use for mass MCing!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

I don't really understand the question but lets give it a try :)<br />
<br />
Tibia options framerate limit reduced to 10<br />
Simply limits the client to draw a maximum of 10 frames per second, the graphic will appear not so smooth, hence the video card won't need as much resources for Tibia.<br />
The clients minimum limit is 10, but this can be pushed by cheats (read further down).. <br />
<br />
Tibia minimized without any bot<br />
Windows 7 is much better than XP when it comes to saving CPU-usage when minimizing windows.<br />
Just be sure to actually minimize Tibia, not just clicking the taskbar icon...Strange exactly why it works this way, but thats how it works anyway :p<br />
<br />
Deactivating light effects<br />
Hardly thinks that this effects computer usage much at all.. maybe for really slow computers<br />
<br />
Tibia mode on Directx 5 / Directx 9 / OpenGL<br />
It differs from every graphic card but most semi-new cards works best with dx9.<br />
<br />
Blackd MC / Neomc<br />
Well, MC as MC :p Guess the only difference is the way they are made to avoid detection for auto-ban.<br />
But has no impact on performance once the client is running.<br />
<br />
Bot manipulation of framerate reduction to 0 or 1 with tibia minimzed<br />
Of course, the best way if you are using many MC's is to run them at as low FPS as possible, by using cheats you can push the client limit (10) down to 0.1...(0 would stop the graphics from updating at all, if its even possible to set it to exactly zero) Also, if using windows 7 minimizing them + 0 fps will cause it use almost no resources from your graphic card, the memory usage will still be the same though. So as long as you have enough memory for all MC's it shouldnt be any problems. Tibia isn't using very much memory anyway...<br />
<br />
To explain how it works, in short: you change the FPS value by writing directly to Tibias memory, since the client limit is 10 - you bypass that with this technique.<br />
<br />
Windows's reduction of Tibia's process priority<br />
Personally, I never noticed any difference at all when switching between different priority levels, however it might make difference to your CPU if you're running a lot of MCs.<br />
<br />
Monitor's resolution configuration / color(16/32mbit) configuration<br />
I always noted a small performance gain when using 16bit over 32bit, but its not much difference at all<br />
For mass MC i suggest 16 bit though.<br />
<br />
I did some mass MC tests, and here's the conclusion:<br />
Use windows 7, minimize all the MC's - will cause almost no CPU usage<br />
The amount of memory on your graphic card will limit how many MC's you can open. I could start around 50 clients with 512mb gpu memory) so rougly 10mb/client. When that's exceeded you will get &quot;video surface allocation failed - error&quot;<br />
RAM usage will also limit you, but since the computer will start using the hard drive (virtual memory) when it runs out of RAM, this wont be a big problem for mass MC (except it will be really slow, ofc)<br />
<br />
In short: graphic card memory is most likely the limit of how many MC's you will be able to run.<br />
Doesn't matter if you set them to 0 fps.</div></div><hr />
