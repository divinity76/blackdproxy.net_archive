Some people say that it didn't happened before. I don't really know why they didn't warned about that before and why they do it now. Maybe some antivirus added some new generic virus patters to their databases. Maybe some 0s and 1s match with a new known generic troyan pattern for some weird reason, but I think there is nothing to worry. Blackd Proxy needs internet connection and needs to read/write memory. That can be considered a generic virus when no specific virus match, and that is a false positive. Anyways, just in case we reuploaded all files and we increased our server security.<br />
 <br />
We have also some users with low post count posting bullshit to try to ruin our reputation.<br />
 <br />
If you have a cheap antivirus just uninstall it. You might have to redownload blackd proxy installer and reinstall it again after that because your antivirus probably already modified or deleted blackd proxy.<br />
 <br />
There is nothing to worry. We compared files and files were still the same as original files. In any case we already reuploaded all files to our servers, just in case.<br />
