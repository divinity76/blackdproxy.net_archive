All the others are just boring! The matches last 10 minutes at minimum and you can't create a real good tactic.<br />
<br />
About the signings you said: I gotta know what's good for your team and your aspirations.<br />
<br />
P.S.: FM 2010 is coming in octuber. I'm praying they make it LESS boring...</div></div><hr />

I'd say you agree with me that the game itself is boring? All those press-meetings to attend, all of your staff saying stuff and etctera...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raoul</div><div class="date">08-05-2010, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a megapack of all the decent youngsters on the game. They are all of the shortlists previously put together by mase, in one download!<br />
<br />
Best to use a large database if you want the full list, but many should be on small/medium as well<br />
<br />
<br />

Best Positional Attributes<br />
<br />
When FMers decide to search for their own players through the player search feature they&#8217;re never quite sure what to search for after the obvious. The following attributes have been selected through a couple minutes thought- after a quick Google search I could only find one other source for this information and that was at FMPortal. (Linked because a few attributes I hadn&#8217;t thought of have been included from that guide)<br />
<br />
Obviously if you&#8217;re with a limited transfer budget there won&#8217;t be any point searching every attribute with 15, because either there&#8217;s no-one that good enough or you won&#8217;t be able to afford, so prioritise the more important skills and tweak the others accordingly<br />
<br />
(I.e. Prioritise Tackling, Jumping, Positioning and Marking with defenders on 15- then be realistic and lower the mark on the concentration, determination and teamwork)<br />
<br />
Goalkeepers<br />
To simplify, the job of a keeper is to protect the goal and to stop the opposition from scoring goals. A solid back four will compliment a keeper, however in the instance the opposing team get past your defence you need to reply heavily on your keeper- will he close the player down, stay on his line and try to keep his composure or will he take the player down and risk conceding a penalty? There&#8217;s one thing to remember as a keeper- there&#8217;s no hiding place!<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Handling, Reflexes, Jumping, Agility, Bravery<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Aerial Ability, Communication, Command of Area, Concentration, Decisions, One on Ones, Positioning, Rushing Out<br />
<br />
Fullbacks<br />
They say good attacking football starts from the back, which is why some teams rely heavily on their fullbacks (Barcelona spring to mind). Scoring is important, but the fans will equally enjoy a defender who slides to steal the ball off an offensive winger when they&#8217;re about to pull the trigger. The modern fullback will often venture beyond the halfway line but their main job is to prevent the opposition attack in wide areas and support the central defenders.<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Tackling, Positioning, Anticipation<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Concentration, Pace, Passing, Decisions, Acceleration, and Teamwork<br />
<br />
If you want more advanced wing backs who look to attack when ever they get the opportunity consider these 3 attributes;<br />
Creativity, Crossing, Dribbling<br />
<br />
Central Defenders<br />
You&#8217;d be useless without them and pretty useless with bad ones. They&#8217;re considered the rock of the team and are undoubtedly two of the most important players on the pitch. Being a central defender is considered a wonderful challenge because against any opposition you&#8217;re testing your own ability. As a center back you cannot relax for a second- there&#8217;s danger on that football field from every possible anger and the whole team relies on you to stop this danger.<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Tackling, Jumping, Positioning, Marking, Strength, Heading<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Anticipation, Bravery, Concentration, Decisions, Determination, Teamwork, Work Rate<br />
Pace, Acceleration, Passing<br />
<br />
Wingers<br />
Much like fullbacks, having wingers in your formation is absolutely optional yet most, if not all world-class managers opt to use them. Brian Clough once said &#8216;When you&#8217;re on the wing, you&#8217;re on your own&#8221;. You can&#8217;t go backwards or sideways because the impetus of the attack will be lost. It takes some serious technical skill- the ability to know you can beat people in order to be a top winger.<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Passing, Creativity, Crossing, Dribbling, Off the Ball, Acceleration, Pace, Stamina<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Agility, Decisions, Composure, Flair, Technique<br />
<br />
Not necessary, but if you really want to define your search for a top winger, tweak;<br />
Finishing, Long Shots, Anticipation<br />
<br />
Defensive Midfielders<br />
Defensive Midfielders can often be the difference between winning and losing. They can prevent the opposition from scoring and within a split second setup their own teams attack with either a pass or a tackle. Also known as the anchor-man or holding midfielder, they simply play in midfield but prioritise defending over attacking.<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Tackling, Positioning, Stamina, Work Rate<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Anticipation, Bravery, Concentration, Decisions, Determination, Jumping, Passing, Strength, Team Work<br />
<br />
Central Midfielders<br />
Central Midfielders are crucial to a teams success, make no doubts about it. This fact is backed by all the top clubs in the country who have world class central midfielders. They are described as the orchestra conductors, the engines of the team, the players pulling the strings from the middle. In the modern game, when top teams lose 3 points their managers will often comment how they &#8220;didn&#8217;t dominate in the middle.&#8221;- that&#8217;s how important central midfielders are.<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Passing, Tackling, Off the Ball, Technique, Composure, Work Rate, Team Work<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Anticipation, Bravery, Concentration, Decisions, Determination, Strength<br />
<br />
Attacking Midfielders<br />
Also known as advanced midfielders who play in the hole. They&#8217;re usually the offensive pivot of the team. Teams who play with one upfront tend to have one midfielder who attacks further than the others. These players, for the opposition are hard to mark because one minute they can be playing quite deep then after just one pass they&#8217;re busting forward leaving the opposing center backs exposed to the main striker.<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Passing, Creativity, Dribbling, Off the Ball, Technique, Composure<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Pace, Acceleration, Agility, Decisions, Finishing, Flair, First Touch<br />
<br />
Forwards (Quick goal scorers)<br />
This player should have one mentality when on the pitch- to score. Some managers choose to prefer playing quick strikers especially against a slow defence. If they have the required skill, have the chance to strike fear in to every central defender.<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Pace, Acceleration, Finishing, First Touch, Dribbling, Off the Ball, Technique, Composure<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Agility, Decisions, Passing, Creativity, Flair<br />
<br />
Strikers (Target men)<br />
Designed to hold up the ball, link play and come up with their fair share of goals. Considered to be dying breed but some managers swear by using a target man, least of all Fabio Capello who swears by a target man/quick striker link. When asked about the importance of Heskey for England who acts as the target man, he answered with &#8220;Rooney is very important for us but Heskey is important for him.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Prioritise;<br />
Strength, Jumping, Heading, Finishing, First Touch, Off the Ball<br />
<br />
Tweak;<br />
Composure, Decisions, Passing, Creativity, Technique</div></div><hr />
