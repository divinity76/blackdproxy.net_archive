<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosforo</div><div class="date">10-22-2011, 03:50</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you have windows vista/7<br />
<br />
solution A) drop your security level in your user account so the program can read/write in his own path. Your windows will act more like Windows XP after that. And in my opinion that is good for 99% of the users.<br />
solution B) force a real copy of the script with this trick: download the script to your desktop. Then copy it from your desktop to blackd proxy folder. (if you copy it directly then windows will decide to copy it in a virtual folder ignoring your order, and then blackd proxy will not be able to find it)<br />
<br />
credits go to blackD</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-23-2011, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">then I guess you have the 2nd most typical problem: you are somehow running Blackd Proxy for Tibia 9.2.<br />
Ensure you go to advanced options and select Tibia 9.31 , then press the button on the right and reload blackd proxy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-24-2011, 13:34</div></div><div class="posttext">If it doesnt work and it block you from doing login when you have it running then I guess the problem is it selected a tibia login server that is temporally not working.<br />
Try going to proxy menu and select a different one.<br />
<br />
login01.tibia.com<br />
<br />
is for working right now (at the moment I wrote this post)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-25-2011, 01:14</div></div><div class="posttext">if you really tested all the solutions above and none of them worked then I don't know... you better format/reinstall Windows because your system is probably very corrupted.</div></div><hr />
