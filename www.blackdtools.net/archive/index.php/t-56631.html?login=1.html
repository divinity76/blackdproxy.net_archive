That is very private information, especially the SS# you can get your identity stolen. Only official government organizations ask for it, can I still buy gold without having to give that information? 
 
 
Just want to say everything I've used from you guys before has been great, and I'm excited to order gold from you. I will leave a very positive review once its all done with, I just need to know if I can avoid" />
