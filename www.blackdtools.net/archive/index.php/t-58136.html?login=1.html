	<meta name="description" content="I had a FW, and got reported for making a offensive statement.  And I guess that was enough for deletion.  I didn't know that I could get deleted for,saying F U to someone so I sent a email to them to please change it since I didn't know offensive statements could cause my account to get deleted.  What do you think my chances are of getting undeletedor is there anything you guys think I should saw to them.  My char is lvl 260, thats why i'm kinda upset about it." />
