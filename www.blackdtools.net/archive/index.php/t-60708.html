Just to let you know, I have trawled through the website and found no valid information to my question and that's why I am posting. Hopefully, someone will have a tried and tested method and get me the right answer. 
 
I am playing a 9.83 client OT. I have turned on Tibia (9.83), changed the IP and then turned on BLACKD Bot. I set up the HP &amp; MANA to heal my mana. When I do, 80% mana, recharge with Great Mana Potion, it works, however I want to use Mana runes.

Just to let you know, I have trawled through the website and found no valid information to my question and that's why I am posting. Hopefully, someone will have a tried and tested method and get me the right answer.<br />
<br />
I am playing a 9.83 client OT. I have turned on Tibia (9.83), changed the IP and then turned on BLACKD Bot. I set up the HP &amp; MANA to heal my mana. When I do, 80% mana, recharge with Great Mana Potion, it works, however I want to use Mana runes.<br />
<br />
&quot;19:06 You see tile ID 7C 0C  with info  + usable2=TRUE + pickupable=TRUE + stackeable=TRUE + haveExtraByte=TRUE&quot;<br />
<br />
I opened up, C drive, program files (win 7), blackd proxy, config 983. Opened up a elevated notepad and changed, the;<br />
<br />
tileID_IH=50 0C<br />
tileID_UH=58 0C<br />
<br />
tileID_health_potion=0A 01<br />
tileID_strong_health_potion=EC 00<br />
tileID_great_health_potion=EF 00<br />
tileID_mana_potion=0C 01<br />
tileID_strong_mana_potion=ED 00<br />
tileID_great_mana_potion=EE 00<br />
tileID_ultimate_health_potion=DB 1D<br />
tileID_great_spirit_potion=DA 1D<br />
tileID_small_health_potion=C4 1E<br />
<br />
I changed all of the above to, 7C 0C. So atleast, any of the potions (health or mana), or IH or UH, will use mana rune. I changed the command on HP &amp; MANA, to exiva ih/ exiva uh and even tried the recharge with mana fluid, mp, smp, gmp, and none of it worked.<br />
<br />
I even changed the folder settings (config.ini) for config folder 1010 and even the config.ini on the main blackd proxy folder. Nothing lets me use the mana rune, please help?<br />
<br />
Also, how can I use the cavebot, to not follow demon, but to attack dragon lord with &quot;Exori Max Frigo&quot;, because I can't see the option anywhere.<br />
<br />
Please Help.</div></div><hr />
