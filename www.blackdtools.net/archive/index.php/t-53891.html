<br />
So on my normal BlackD account, I was banned for the following Reasons<br />
<br />
&quot;Trying to buy every single character&quot; When Really I wrote messages on like 5-7 threads for people trying to sell there characters .. Because half the people end up being scammers..<br />
<br />
And on my other blackD account Ive been a supporter and member of blackD for over 3 years and had over 470+ posts, a lot of people know me here aswell.<br />
<br />
I think its utterly pathetic when I bid on character's i'm SERIOUS about buying (that is if they turn out not to be scammers) and I get banned for it, TALK ABOUT POWER ABUSE?<br />
Seems some mod's like to bann people for fun? (Not all, Actually the mod's Ive met seem to be very nice and helpful people) BUT NOT BLADE.All the threads I posted on I said &quot;add my on msn so we can talk&quot; or &quot;How much are you looking for&quot; I DIDNT SAY &quot;hey ill buy account add me&quot;<br />
<br />
so thats pathetic to be banned for that... I'm Sure this post will be deleted because thats how POWER ABUSING WORKS. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AND MY BANN WAS 1-13-2011 AND NOW I'M BANNED UNTIL 1-20-20011  and it says &quot;For no apparent reason&quot; <br />
<br />
LOL HE BANNED ME 1 MORE WEEK FOR NOTHING?!?!! What kind of madness and power abusing is that?!?!!??!<br />
<br />
THAT IS STRAIGHT POWER ABUSE, I SENT Blackd or (daniel) Email and PM, If this problem isnt fix, I'm never ordering blackD safe cheats again, I got banned for NOTHING, and then get an additional week for speaking my mind!??:!?!! LOLOLOL Wow..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your ban won't last forever if you stfu<br />
<br />
P.s stop talking about your post count. We don't care if you spammed more than users who only post useful content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now when he gets unbanned: Be more cautious when dealing with him.</div></div><hr />

I just cehcked my pms too<br />
<br />
<br />
Blade, M5city here, With all due respect, I would really appreciate you remove my ban, I'm posting on Character's I'm actually willing to offer on, Since half of them turn out to be scammers, You seem like a nice guy, Ive heard about you from a lot of people on blackD, Ive been a member a long time, But maybe just perhaps you were mistaken? I'm posting on accounts I actually want.. and when my status sasy &quot;banned&quot; that really doesnt help me... With all due kindness can you please remove my bann? Please... I did nothing wrong I would really apprecaite kindness from you... Please .. I hope you aknowledge my request. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blade, please my friend. :/<br />
<br />
    I'm writing you one more message, And I won't bother you anymore, I really hope you find the kindness in your heart to remove my bann, I didn't do anything wrong, I was bidding on ALL those accoun'ts I posted on, half the people end up being friggin scammers, so I bid on more than just one, Im talking to someone who i think is a scammer on MSN as i write this letter! Man, I heard your a cool guy, I really hope you will remove my bann...I've been a supporter of blackD over 2 years.. and I dont think that's fair. :/ <br />
<br />

Not saying thats he's right or wrong. <br />
I have no call on other mods actions. I tend to support them, as I do now.<br />
I know Blade wouldn't do something to Power Abuse anyone so yes, I laughed about this topic.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Pretty amazing spam he did.<br />
Watching the vid in HQ and fullscreen made me try to roll the bar down several times...</div></div><hr />
