About:<br />
<br />
The script start at the east venore depot (bottom floor) and will hunt at Orc Fortress (outside) until the bot is low on cap or potions. The hunts will loop until a server save or until the player just have 15 hours stamina left (then it will logout). This is great for optimal profit and exp-gain.<br />
<br />
The script contains a potion refiller and item depositer and uses mana potions and strong health potions as default. It also contains some other features as checkpoint checks. They check if the character have succeded in withdrawing money from the bank, bought potions, sold all halberds at the shop, deposited all cash after a hunt and check the glowing switches at the depot so the bot does not fail whilst depositing items. With this features, the bot do never leave town without any supplies nor restart a new hunt before selling and depositing all items. The only thing you will have to do is clean your depot when it is full of items (recommended to do one time per 12 hours). One extra feature that I added was that it also will kill Feverish Citizen and pick up addon items if a raid occur when the bot is in the city.<br />
The script will also calculate and log all profit from cash, items and creature products and how much exp the bot has gained from a certain round in the players log.txt-file. Here is an example from my log:<br />
<br />
on 22-02-2013 at 06:58:41, [hidden character name] (level 77) got 11897gp profit and 89135 exp from a hunt at of (outside). the hunt was 183 minutes long.<br />
on 22-02-2013 at 08:51:38, [hidden character name] (level 77) got 9298gp profit and 43461 exp from a hunt at of (outside). the hunt was 93 minutes long.<br />
on 24-02-2013 at 09:30:48, [hidden character name] (level 80) got 11288gp profit and 62845 exp from a hunt at of (outside). the hunt was 71 minutes long.<br />
<br />
Total average profit from over 200 hunts was for me about 7-16k profit per hunt with about 24-60k exp per hour.<br />
<br />
It is also possible to make your bot to leave earlier if you write exiva _leave = 1 in the client, a useful feature if you want to leave and logout at the depot but can not be arsed to restart the script manually to force the bot to leave or leave manually. exiva _leave = 0 is on default, which means the bot will continue to loop the hunting. <br />
<br />
The bot will pick up items like:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Gold Coin<br />
Orc Leather<br />
Orc Tooth<br />
Skull Belt<br />
Broken Helmet<br />
Old and Used Backpack (not lootable outside, but just for sure)<br />
Orcish Gear<br />
Halberd<br />
Health Potion<br />
Sword Ring<br />
Warrior Helmet<br />
Broken Shamanic Staff<br />
Shamanic Hood<br />
Wand of Decay<br />
Wand of inferno<br />
Dragon Hammer<br />
Serpent Sword<br />
Dragon Shield<br />
Dragonbone Staff<br />
<br />
Recommendations:<br />
<br />
It works best for knights and is great to use between level 60-85+ if you have bad skills. If your knight have good skills, it will probably be possible to start as early as around level 50 or maybe even earlier.<br />
<br />
Benefits:<br />
<br />
1. Orc Fortress (outside) gives quite good exp and stable profit per hour. <br />
<br />
2. With this script, you can afk 99% without bothering. The only thing that can stop you is summons (if a player hunt at the dragon cave with orc leaders) or if the venore bank is robbed and if your depot is full of items.<br />
<br />
3. Safe hunting. Since the area outside Orc Fortress is really open, it is nearly impossible to get trapped by bot-hunters which is awesome.<br />
<br />
Drawbacks:<br />
<br />
1. As above, you can get stopped by noobs hunting at dragons with orc leaders or if the venore bank gets robbed. However, this is extremly rare and will probably not affect you on a noticable level. You will have to clean your depot by yourself as your depot will be over-flooded with items looted by the bot. <br />
