I was using x-ray with a brunch of characters, to make some tests, and they were crashing my tibia. I have no idea what could cause this. 
Does anyone has the same error ?" />

But not 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-11-2010, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">you should avoid trying to watch impossible floors for your current level.<br />
 <br />
at default level or higher you can only watch the upper half of the floors.<br />
at underground you can watch up to +2 floors and up to -2 floors<br />
 <br />
anyways after intensive usage it might crash. Just dont report the debug and you will be safe.<br />
 <br />
I will have a safer xray done soon. It will draw the map in a window like current Blackd Proxy Truemap do. It is not exactly the same that clasic xray but my version will have zero chance of crash.</div></div><hr />
