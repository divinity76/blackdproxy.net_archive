	<meta name="description" content="Hi, 
Haven't been playing tibia for 5 years. Had some time to spend now so I started to play again on one of my accounts created in 2009. It only had 2 chars, one level 8 knight with 75/75 skills. 
 
I remember the goal was to reach 100/100. I wanted to have atleast 90/90 before I started to play seriously, so I got some spellwands took level 10 and found a empty spot noone could find, really proud of this spot to be honest.  
 
The character was online perhaps 16-17 hours per day. I work night" />
