 <br />
Are you a mod? I ask so because you appear as a 'senior member', I don't mean to offend you or something xD <br />
and I quote again the the part of my thread about Satanás, I sent him exactly the same PM that I sent to Razoor, and he didn't do anything</div></div><hr />

For sure you should have noticed the Sticky that says xHellsx is a mod, right?... In my eyes lately theres been loads of active mods on the forum, more than needed actually.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I obviously hadn't noticed about it, other wise I wouldn't have asked so xD but well, anyways I just want to say that I think that Hurriel would be a great choice for a mod position, and I haven't even talked to him<br />
<br />
I just saw that sticky about you three being moderators, didn't know it until now lol, dunno why you don't have the 'moderator' tittle. then I take back my words about the lack of moderators here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadow1</div><div class="date">12-12-2010, 02:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Ye there are plenty of mods on daily, more then needed i guess. I doubt any new mods will be hired for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-12-2010, 02:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! I'm really glad to see that someone noticed and appreciates my work around here :)<br />
I've applied once to become moderator but i had no luck at all hehe. I would not mind to become a moderator, of course, but the actual ones here are doing an excellent work. Unfortunately some do not even care about this anymore.<br />
Being or not a moderator, i will continue to help this community since it helped me to grow up a lot as a Tibia Player.</div></div><hr />

I almost check all threads every day, and I think you'r wrong about the 'loads of active, more than needed' part.<br />
sure there's alot of mods on this forum but the only mod i can name here doing something is Razoor.<br />
ofc i can be wrong, prove me wrong if you want to, would even appreciate if you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">12-12-2010, 04:56</div></div><div class="posttext">To me an active moderator is not a mod that posts a lot, but that takes matters into hand, deletes spam, bans users that really need a ban, etc etc. Since mods can see other mods work, I have to say they do a great job.<br />
<br />
And Hurriel does an awesome job tbh, almost everyday I get mails from reported posts that are his, just in two weeks Ive deleted around 10 threads and posts thanks to him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlzNoKil</div><div class="date">12-12-2010, 05:34</div></div><div class="posttext">so now i can name two mods i guess..<br />
well, thats enough for me, you proven your point :)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Calling me a spammer is abit harsh isn't it? ;o</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Half the posts in this thread were made by moderators. And I dont even think you've read the whole thread xD I mean, after 6-7 posts someone mentioned an important Sticky which Im aware you havent read xD I mean, 4 different mods have already replied to this thread....</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-13-2010, 01:32</div></div><div class="posttext">xDDDD pwnt! so this thread seems useless now, should be closed..<br />
<br />
Usually, threads are only closed if they are leading to multiple misunderstandings, conflicts, insults, situations that can degenerated the forum reputation. This is not the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">12-13-2010, 06:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for the matter: There are mods ppl dont know doing the job ppl dont wanna know about.<br />
About this topic: I tried myself to give Hurriel some diffrent title, like Helper or stuff like this but it seems I don't have the level it needs. I'd ask blackd to do that if all mods agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blade</div><div class="date">12-14-2010, 06:57</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't post much lately this is true.... I get in get my shit done and get out.<br />
<br />
Its not all its cracked up to be to be honest if you TRULY TRULY WANT IT I could make a youtube of how us mods do shit.</div></div><hr />
