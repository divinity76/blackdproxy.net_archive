What i 'd like to do is to set up the delay for more seconds... 
Example: 
Press F1(Hmm) if mana is less than 100(Always) with a delay of 525000 ms betwen recharges. 
 
It is like this, every 525 seconds (time to do an hmm rune on free mage) it will cast F1 spell. 
 
Same with the using food stuff but with a smaller delay like 180000 ms (for meat)" />

What i 'd like to do is to set up the delay for more seconds...<br />
Example:<br />
Press F1(Hmm) if mana is less than 100(Always) with a delay of 525000 ms betwen recharges.<br />

<br />

<br />
Right now i am doing it with the maximum delay time but it is only 10 seconds so it is kind of wird stay doing puffs 51 times before the rune goes out.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you increase the delay time it would be more human to make runes with the BSC.<br />
<br />
Now, there could be some more easy stuff we could add to do it safer from pks... like adding an alarm if a change is done on battle list.<br />
Actually there is a tool on free cheats that do so but it would be nice to get it added on the safe chat with an option of &quot;push ctrl+q&quot; instead of alarm in case of loging out or whatever... and i don't thing it would be risky to add that feature.. in that way we could have a Semi-AFK runer with an alarm completly safe.</div></div><hr />
