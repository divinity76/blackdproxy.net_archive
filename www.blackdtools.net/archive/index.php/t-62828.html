<br />
I saw Github and guys do good job optimizing the code but almost I did was more design than edit the code itself.<br />
<br />
Blackd NG had an friendly UI with some very needed functions (sdmax, etc). But I did total mess in the code also 'corrupted' its core. I didnt expect Blackd would acceot/release it.<br />
<br />
This new version is made from CLASSIC source, with minimum changes into its code. Its is almost an &quot;addon&quot;, that add the interface above. All the code I created are at least organized and sould work properly</div></div><hr />
