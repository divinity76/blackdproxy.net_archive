Not under your new nick which I guess it is, since it's registered last month. :p</div></div><hr />

Yeah, old one was registered about 5 years ago (couldn't remember the darn account details! :@) or so but I was more of a lurker back then. xD</div></div><hr />

I remembered your name as soon as I saw it, altough I can't recall if we actually talked.<br />
<br />
@rest;<br />
Thank you :)<br />
Already released a cond for exori strikes, but I think that's a repost since I'm pretty sure I put it up here when I created it a few years back... Anyways. Should start dropping in once my new druid is out of rotworms... :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone hacked my forum account or used some kind of phpBB exploit and said a guy was trusted when he wasn't.<br />
I can even prove I wasn't able to be online during the time but I don't have the energy to clean up my rep. I don't give a fuck what people think of me, as long as I can keep this nick so people still know it's me I'm happy.<br />
<br />
ONT: This forum is in serious need of recussitation....</div></div><hr />

You are not referring to me now are you?</div></div><hr />

One great way to recussitate this forum is by making great scripts.. which I am sure you will! and hopefully I will when I get back to Tibia.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't the guy I supposedly trusted something starting with blad too? I don't think he's referring to you in his post anyways.<br />
OffT: I sent you a PM, if you want to talk just send one back.<br />
