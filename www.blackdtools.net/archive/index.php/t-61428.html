<br />
I wrote Mage Project because I want to be a mage and pvp, but havent decided If I would like to make lots of money selling uhs as a druid or play sorcerer because that's my favourite voc. (Maybe one of each since I'll be playing on two worlds?)<br />
<br />
Im currently botting up some characters on Aurera meanwhile I wait for my Premium.<br />
<br />
Let's be honest here, BlackD forums aren't as active as they used to be but it would be fun if someone commented or gave me tips where to hunt/bot etc.<br />
<br />
I will upload some screenshots, maybe upload the scripts im using for my facc.<br />
<br />
But untill then, cya!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Made a new acc using one of my facc to invite me and then I bought 3 premium scrolls on the new acc so I got 10 days free premium on my old acc.<br />
<br />
Going to start botting now on the old acc at larvas!<br />
<br />
EDIT: all of the caves were full, that's the downside of playing on a high populated server...<br />
So taking a little break from botting and starting on Lunara!</div></div><hr />
