	<meta name="description" content="Hello! I seem to have a problem with the auto - healing delay (hp). I currently have 3 options for my healing: exura, exura gran and exura vita. The first one works perfectly, with the delay that I wish to have. However, as soon as either the second or the third option  must kick in, the spell is used almost instantly. My question is: why do the other 2 options completely disregard the intended delay?  
 
Thanks in advance! :) 
 
P.S. The delay always works for the very first line in the auto -" />

P.S. The delay always works for the very first line in the auto - healing section. What's interesting, if I have a spell that is located in either the second or the third line (with no other healing options!), the intended delay doesn't kick in.</div></div><hr />

Test it if you feel like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">09-07-2015, 18:09</div></div><div class="posttext">have you tried using Conditional Event's instead? something like<br />
<br />
$myhppercent$ #number&lt;=# 30<br />
or if you want to get fancy, <br />
$istrue:{$check:{$myhppercent$},#number&lt;=#,{30}},{$check:{$mymana$},#number&gt;=#,{100}$}$<br />
<br />
action: exura vita<br />
<br />
cooldown: 5000<br />
<br />
or something along those lines :p (untested, maybe i have a typo somewhere)</div></div><hr />
