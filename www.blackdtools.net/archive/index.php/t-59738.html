1. What do I script in order to open a hole in the sand? (Like, open hole for tombs).<br />
<br />
2. If I were about to hunt, lets say Vampires, what can I script so it will use Blessed Wooden Stake on its body after looted?<br />
<br />
3. I believe this is a easy one, but I have not found the script... Assume I have a label for depositing on ':deposit'. If I were attacked by a PK, what can I write so my character will run the same way as ':deposit'? Will say, it will return to botting place after it deposited everything. <br />
<br />
4. Is it possible to add a reconnecter, so that it will login 30 minutes after logout (reasons could be server save, killed, internet kick...) and return to cavebot? By this I mean a safe reconnecter, a script that will require account and password.<br />
<br />
5. Also an easy one, I just need the script for going to ':deposit' when I have X amount of items. If I have looted for instance 30 iron ores then it should go to depositing.<br />
<br />
It's some questions, I'd be really happy if you're able to answer them all. I'll contribute to the forum once I am complete doing the many scripts. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen on other tomb-threads with depositors that they use some kind of fastExiva script with a massive amount of numbers after for shovelling. But I definitely understand the risk if it will send the wrong packets as you say.<br />
<br />
Edit: Does this mean that in order to script a depositer into my tomb scripts, I must take a huge risk because I can't open the tomb hole entrances?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't to that with this bot.<br />
<br />
I thought on fore-hand that the &lt;useItem ~~~~&gt; feature in the Cavebot could be used in some advanced setting to do this. But if it's impossible and not edit-able, then I understand.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for the rest of the answers!</div></div><hr />

Thanks zihinu, even answered a question for myself. I was wondering about opening up tombs for quite some time but like you said, sending packets id rather stick to stairs/rope holes. Great advice, keep up the good work bud.<br />
