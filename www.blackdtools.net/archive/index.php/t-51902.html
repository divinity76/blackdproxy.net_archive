Today, 6656 Tibia accounts have been excluded from the game for using unofficial software to play during the last couple of weeks. These accounts have been identified by our automatic tool. For this reason, complaints about these punishments are in vain.<br />
<br />
haha</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, there aren't any safe bot with cavebot.<br />
<br />
ghostbot = detectable (some forum users get banished)<br />
neobot = detectable (tested by me, formated pc, using only neobot, i don't used/instaled mc, ipchanger or other bot after format)<br />
elfbot = detectable (everyone know)<br />
tibiabot ng = detectable (everyone know)<br />
Blackd Proxy (bot) = detectable (everyone know)<br />
tibia auto = detectable (everyone know)<br />
<br />
Blackd Safe Cheats = undetectable i think, but dont have cavebot. (not sure if is 100% safe, never used this before)</div></div><hr />
