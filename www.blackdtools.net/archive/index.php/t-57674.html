	<meta name="description" content="Hi all, 
 
Keen to give this program a go, however, no matter what I do it simply doesn't work for me. 
 
I have Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit, Avast, and ZoneAlarm. 
 
I've added exceptions to the above security programs though I still have no functionality. 
 
I can run BSC, install it fine, but the hotkeys refuse to run. None of the other functions seem to do anything for me as well." />

<br />
then you can also try uninstalling your antivirus (in some cases disabling/pausing them is not enough)</div></div><hr />

Is there any other way to get this working without sacrificing my security?</div></div><hr />
