The runemaker wasnt working on 7.72, even doh I changed the blank rune and the rune I'm making ID in the config, it still refused to pick up the runes to my selected hand. This cond have helped me and hopefully it will help someone else aswell. Thanks!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Damn.. Doesn't work when having multiple bp's of blanks.. It gets &quot;stuck&quot; after one backpack is completed. Any way to fix it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zmulan</div><div class="date">04-22-2012, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">@up, have a look here:<br />

<br />
The first cond I posted probably work, but Ive got and updated one that works better if you're using a weapon/shield also.<br />
<br />
Will make a rune if mana percent above 90, if mana is lower it will always make sure your weapon or shield is equipped (works about the same as the runemaker does, without soulpoint bug)<br />
<br />
exiva #D4 08 05 - blank rune ID and hand (05 right, 06 for left hand)<br />
exiva #DD 09 05 - id of your shield/weapon (dwarven shield in this case) and hand, use the same as above<br />
<br />
And oh! almost forgot, for it work work smooth just remove 1 blank rune from every rune bp. Should work with multiple bps without problems although I usually just got 1 bp open at a time.<br />
