	<meta name="description" content="Daniel, Im curious if you have run into this problem. But persay I have two paladins to train and stones to pickup out of a bag, when I activate trainer and set up all the correct details f5 06 in the hand etc when less than &lt; 0 refill max 100 into Left hand from any backpack so its all set right but once I try to set up a second paladin with a trainer command it only works for the first one I set? Is it possible to trainer more then one char at the same time? 
Just out of curiousity Daniel!" />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">09-08-2012, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the command stop if target is under 50% worked for me, but then it would never begin the attack when it was healed. Anywho, curious if anyone has been able to set up multiple chars with trainer, and or multiple items such as amulets, rings, and boots all at once? :O<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">09-15-2012, 19:25</div></div><div class="posttext">It has come to my attention there is a fix with trainer! This does not solve the multiple character issue, but this fixes the multiple items on one character. I wrote an email to Daniel and he filled me in with a tad bit a of knowledge I would like to pass on. <br />
<br />
If you set up trainer as according all your item IDs and which slot it is in i.e RING EC 0B &lt;1 if you set the ITEM ID to 00 00 underneath the picture, and set it as from Any Backpack in the destination of items box and voila it now should read more then one single item auto-equipping when run out. Thanks again Daniel, I hope this explained it well enough I am slightly stoned and it is first thing in the morning shoot me a question if you still do not understand!<br />
