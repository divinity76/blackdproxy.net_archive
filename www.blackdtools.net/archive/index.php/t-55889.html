:)<br />
<br />
It is safe? i saw something in other bot page that says that cycsoft now can detect the keyboard hack for bot ):</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-18-2012, 13:52</div></div><div class="posttext">It is safe? i saw something in other bot page that says that cycsoft now can detect the keyboard hack for bot ):<br />
yes, I am tired of saying it: Blackd Safe Cheats is still safe.<br />
And please don't trust in other bots. They only will hack you. There is a lot of propaganda on trashbot and shitbot everywhere in the net now, trying to catch old of neobot users. Beware of such new bots!<br />
<br />
Blackd Safe Cheats is an old well tested safe bot, with open source. It is safe and it is free of hacks. Don't worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">01-18-2012, 20:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Does it work similar to Neo which is mouse/keyboard clicks? I mean does it modify the client in any way?<br />
Never used it before, I do not want to get banned once I start using it :)<br />
I just need healing.<br />
<br />
/Also I see that you can only set 2 spells to heal yourself. Is it possible to set more? Like a mage uses exura, exura gran and exura vita.</div></div><hr />

Btw a question: I just downloaded the bot, but i Read something about a registration or something. Since im new I want to know wahts meant with that.</div></div><hr />

don't worry: you don't need to update BSC in little patches. you are still safe. And if there is a big patch bsc will stop working for you until you update it so there is no risk about updates in any case.</div></div><hr />

all my programs are updated for 9.44 at this moment, so if any of them does not work for you that is because a problem with your computer, config, or paths.</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU! That's really great to hear that, cannot thank you enough. Made my day, Daniel.<br />
<br />
/EDIT<br />
Tested and works like a charm. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you going to update the anti-afk tool too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coks</div><div class="date">08-09-2012, 07:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Works great for a bot that's completely safe and free.. what more do you want?<br />
<br />
I don't really need much more than what BlackD Safe Cheats has to offer but it would be nice to see some new (minor) features on it such as a runemaker (Yeah I saw the other runemaker made by a forum member but I won't take the risk)~~ Great work<br />
<br />
I haven't used the X-ray and True Map yet though, isn't X-ray extemely unsafe? Or can I use it without any risk (I know stupid question sry :|)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">08-09-2012, 12:10</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know anything about x-ray and other, just dont use them if you dont need them :D<br />
What I would love to see in BSC is anti-paralyse and maybe as you said a runemaker. I think it is better that it doesnt have many functions, it remains safe that way ^^ but anti-paralyse for me is important, that's why I asked for it some time ago and Daniel said he might add it in future se let's wait and hope for it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coks</div><div class="date">08-29-2012, 03:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm starting to have trouble every time I use Blackd Safe Cheats, every time I get attacked by a monster or a player my Num Lock (number lock) activates again. I always have it deactivated because I walk diagonally witht the numbers all he time. It looks like it activates every time it uses a healing spell (when i get attacked = use f1 or f4 or f10 for mana or spell)...<br />
<br />
Details: I only have hotkeys on the F# hotkeys not the shift or ctrl ones any ideas how to make it stop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">08-29-2012, 17:36</div></div><div class="posttext">My BSC seems to not work :o After the patch it starts, loads config and all normally but it just doesnt heal me :D<br />
<br />
Am I the only one or the patch caused it to stop working?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">08-29-2012, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some test and everything worked in BSC.<br />
just ensure that you have tibia 9.63 and ensure you are using BSC for tibia 9.63</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">08-30-2012, 16:27</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah my BSC was 9.60 :) Going to download it now.<br />
<br />
/It is working now, it was my fault for not checking the version :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">08-31-2012, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still waiting for you to add an awesome anti-paralyse with some options like &quot;different % of hp and paralysed then exura/exura gran/exura vita&quot; or something like that :D Or at least utani hur so it does not mess the healing.<br />
But that is ofc if you will be able to do that, not gonna try to force you, I remember your words that you may and I still have faith in that.</div></div><hr />
