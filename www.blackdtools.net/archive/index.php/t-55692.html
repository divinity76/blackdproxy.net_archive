When I type it in the client, it will be said in-game. I don't see anywhere in the Conds screen where I can type that.<br />

Thanks ahead. Script looks really thorough and hope I can give it a try!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
*edit* Just tried it, didn't work. Perhaps they changed something in 9.1 that broke that part of the script.<br />
Oh well for me.</div></div><hr />

I'M SERIOUSLY NOT DOING THIS BECAUSE MY VERSION COMES UP IN AN HOUR OR TWO...<br />
But noone will believe that. Whatever.<br />
I mean how can he call it advanced if he doesn't even follow the post by admin in this very forum telling advanced scripters to do it? (http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?54377-advanced-scripters-How-to-open-doors-safely)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lolcp</div><div class="date">11-22-2012, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, lets get you the feedback.<br />
<br />
This night I ran this script on three new characters at the same time. I started them at the same time as well. <br />
<br />
When I woke up I saw all three of them standing at Isle of Destiny as level 7 knights, with no weapon. <br />
<br />
SO - THIS MUST BE EDITTED:<br />
<br />
1) Thank you very much for the script. It worked 99% very good. Thanks.<br />
2) Since I was sleeping all the way from start to Isle of Destiny, I can only witness two problems: that it DIES when hunting dwarves/bugs (as all my three characters died and are level 7), and also it DOESN'T pick the weapon correctly.<br />
<br />
Thank you again. See this as constructive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">11-25-2012, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is very tough to keep every script up to date with all the packets, when someone has stated that the script is only working at  a certain version you are taking a risk yourself by playing a cavebot script with outdated packet commands. Thanks again for all your hard work zinihu~, sorry to hear you weren't as pleased Malmis but you should give him a break, hes contributing to the community and not asking for anything in return especially when, ~10 people are complaining nothing is working because they don't even know how to load conditionals. Great work Zinihu, keep it up man.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanoz</div><div class="date">01-15-2013, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Worked fine for me, just use the &quot; main&quot;  vocation and you will wake up in main, why bother that 1 lvl on your chosen vocation. Its a good script thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradoxic</div><div class="date">05-22-2013, 17:25</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the first script I have ran, it worked like magic (9.86 live server / 5/22/13 ) Only things I was confused on is it tried to go up the hole in Al Dees rat cave, when I had no rope and I panicked because I thought I was trapped forever. It placed me in isle of destiny with no voc when I chose a knight, I suspect this is due to the NPC that is new there, and the changes they made.<br />
<br />
I'd love to test any further scripts you make, I'll be checking out Carlin Sewers next. Would you mind me editing this script to accommodate the &quot;new isle&quot; ?</div></div><hr />
