	<meta name="description" content="Hi i recently got sick of my knight so ive started a pally, im level 29 and pretty much have access to any equipment/supplies i want and i can waste as much as i want/need as i have a shitload of spare cash in excess of 10kk+ 
 
so what im asking is where would you powerlevel a paladin to get to 120+ as quick as possible? and ill be doing it manually since i dont bot, but i dont have access to a blocker so ill have to be soloing creatures (then again i dont give a shit how much pots i waste)
