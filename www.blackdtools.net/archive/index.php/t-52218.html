<br />
Thanks for answer.<br />
 <br />
1. Verified paypal account can't do it ?<br />
2. If it's done by company like http://bmtmicro.com/ can unverified paypal account chargeback ?<br />
3. How many time they have for chargeback ?<br />
4. They can chargeback without giving reason of doing so for Paypal ?</div></div><hr />

1.- Both verified and unverified can do chargebacks. However unverified paypals are usually stolen cards.<br />
2.- All paypal's can get chargeback<br />
3.- I think up to 2-4 weeks<br />
4.- There are a lot of ways you can do a chargeback, like calling your bank and said your card was tolen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">09-05-2010, 13:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Chargebacks are always possible. However you have an higher chance to receive chargebacks if payment came from an unverified paypal account.<br />
 <br />
My hint: ask for double money for users with unverified paypal accounts. That will pay the extra risk. An honest customer usually will get their account verified to save money. Because money comes from his own pocket. In the other hand, thiefs don't care because credit card was stolen to other person. And in most cases they can't do paypal verification unless they also steal online bank account login/password.<br />
 <br />
It is also a good idea to limit how many money can you accept from same unverified paypal email each month. That way maths will always be in your side, and you willl always win money, even if 50% of your customers with unverified accounts are thiefs.</div></div><hr />
