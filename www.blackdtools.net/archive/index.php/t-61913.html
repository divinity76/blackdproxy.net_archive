<br />
A new highrate server is going to be launched very soon. The chosen protocol at the moment is 8.0.<br />
The server will have rates desired for people to enjoy the game abit faster, a slight boost on every rate option thus a more excessive one on the lootrate. [higher lootrate]<br />
<br />
Many new features and fixes from the previous edition will be patched. Conjuring runes through backpack will be one of these things.<br />

Also every 24 hours there will be special rewards, more about this will be introduced later.<br />
<br />
Why OriginalTibia?<br />
OriginalTibia.com has a reputation of honesty and co-operated respect. Which in other words indicates that the player's voice is one of the greatest tools here and the community is what forms this server and shapes it together with the staff into the best server out there today.<br />
