i'm a total noob about making cavebots and i dont know if it's hard to make, but since i dont see any anti cheat programs i think its not that hard to make 1 :$?<br />
<br />
And i have seen some threats that most blackd members played or are still playing this game.<br />
<br />
So i tought if some1 already made or began making a bot for this game :$?<br />

<br />
From what I have heard Zezenia have made it very hard for people to find addresses (which is very simple in Tibia) due to multi-level pointers to simple things such as HP</div></div><hr />
