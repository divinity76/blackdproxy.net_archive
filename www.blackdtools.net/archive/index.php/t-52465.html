<br />
It is known by everyone that we all want a safe bot that we can use and don't get caught by CIP. In order to know if a version is safe we need to test it -duh!-, so I made this thread to keep track of information that people contribute about the latest version.<br />
<br />
So this is how it will work. In order to count in this and to be absolutely sure that in case you get banned it was because of the latest version, only characters have been created after the last banwave Sep 08 2010 can be used. In addition, this characters have to be in an account where either no character has ever used any cheating tool or it was created after Sep 08 2010. It is absolutely vital that you do no use any other cheating programs with this accounts/characters so we can have accurate results.<br />
<br />
In order to keep track of the characters you use to test, please number them starting from 1 and I'll label them in the record tables. For example, my first character would be labeled as BldMx #1. Also please post the number of hours that you will be  using the blackd proxy and the type of cheats that you will use (mc, bots, conditional events, training, etc). If and when you get banish in any of these characters please post a reply to update your info. Hopefully, the cheats used in the accounts would help us clarify things about what is causing these bans. <br />
<br />
All help is really appreciated since the more characters we test, the better we can make conclusions.<br />
I will start the list with my characters that I have just created. Characters 6 and 7 will take a while before I start using bots since ill take them to main manually before sing cheats as they train.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Character          Hours per day         Cheats used<br />
BldMx #1              05                 Bots, Healing<br />
BldMx #2              08                 Bots, Healing<br />
BldMx #3              10                 Bots, Healing<br />
BldMx #4              12                 Bots, Healing<br />
BldMx #5              15                 Bots, Healing<br />
BldMx #6              --                 Training, Healing, Fishing<br />
BldMx #7              --                 Training, Healing, Fishing<br />
BldMx #8              12                 Fishing<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to test what exactly might cause the bans I will use some characters for just certain things, like just training (will manually take lvl 2 chars to main), just fishing, just mana-stting etc. If you can do this it would be great! <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, and enjoy Tibia!</div></div><hr />

<br />
@BldMx, hey u should put the days ur bottin ur chars ( like Sep 11 2010, 10:24:31 CEST to Sep 11 2010, 15:24:31 CEST ) so it will be really good to know the hours and DATE of the waves , cause i rlly think its about some &quot;day&quot; they make the bans, ill do somethin like u too, but i want/need more characters to do it cause of the stamina, but ill need to make all the accounts first then ill create the same as ur doin, im puttin them all on my project, u should pass ur project there too, or we can create one for both too<br />
well.. tats all for now :)<br />

One ban wave is not enough. We need to wait a bit more so we can 100% sure that its really undetectable.</div></div><hr />

atm<br />
(Moneymakers A)<br />
6 deleted<br />
8 Safe<br />
( the one deleted here bot at same time at same hour, so my theory seems to be right, they make a scan and delete the ones bottin at that time of the scan )<br />
( Moneymakers B)<br />
All of them are safe, so i could say, yes they got certain scan time or smthin like tat so they check up whos bottin and whos not</div></div><hr />
