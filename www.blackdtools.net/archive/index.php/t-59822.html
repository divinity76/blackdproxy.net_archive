been 24/7.<br />
<br />
I botted at LB Tarantulas &amp; Rots (deposit on guildhall liberty bay) / Laguna (all kind of scripts there, had that house in meriana to deposit) / Apes PH (all kind of scripts here, eg: groundfloor, -1 &amp; -2, all together...  deposit at Treehouse Guildhall.)<br />
<br />
Also i used some &quot;hard&quot; functions, as charge bps with gold with trainer, antipush etc...<br />
I dont know why i haven't been caught, but i put the NPC shit as main cause .</div></div><hr />

&quot;6231 Tibia accounts have been detected using unofficial software to play during the last couple of weeks. These accounts have been deleted today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Six (!) of my accounts have been deleted. I only used Blackd Proxy to bot, and I always write my own scripts, which don't use any special hex commands, just the regular cavebot commands. :(<br />
<br />
We noticed that the 6 accounts were using scripts containing exiva buy / sell<br />
They can be dangerous commands, specially if you try to sell ZERO items. Client would never send such packets. Anyways I will upload a new version that will not send any packet to server if the amount is zero.<br />
<br />
Again it have been proven that the people using very basic scripts were not detected.<br />
<br />
Note: Blackd Proxy 27.6 ready! it should decrease a bit the risk of using exiva buy/sell. Anyways they are still dangerous commands if you try to sell things that you don't have or you try to buy more than you can carry. You better be very carefull when using them.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your report. It looks like depositer commands are now safe after latest changes.</div></div><hr />

Does it take into account the money you have on you? E.g. buying something of 8000gp when you only have 4682gp is not possible and when the bot will try to do it, it'll send a wrong hex -&gt; easily detected</div></div><hr />

<br />
@BlackD Community, Wow love to see the many posts in here guys, we are finally growing again. I would have to say I am liking the amount of people contributing as of late.<br />

<br />
No. Bot won't check everything and of course if you don't have enough gold for your intended purchase that is another way to get detected.<br />
You better don't use such commands at all in your scripts unless you understand the risks there.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm. I was using this command on 2 characters and they have been deleted. On others I was using script without it (very basic scripts) and they survived. Sorry if there are any mistakes, I'm not very good in English.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-20-2012, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">ouch im sorry to hear that Seviss~ I had tested that command out myself on a few different accounts, after checking all accounts seem to be fine, but I wasnt running a continuous script with exiva buy/sell.. On a side note, whenever I did try to use this command I had 100% sure enough cap and money to purchase the items so I can see why I was not affected..<br />
<br />
I was puzzled how you would include exiva buy in a script with always having the correct amt of money and it finally came to me in a dream...<br />
<br />
Start Script&gt;Fill Up&gt;Start Deposit&gt;Instead of depositing Cash first, goto Potion shop say deposit all, yes&gt;Go Deposit ALL cash&gt;Deposit Loots&gt;Withdraw EXACT Amt of Cash required for refill&gt;Refill&gt;Go Back to Start of Script&gt;Repeat.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this makes some form of sense because It did as I was typing it ;p The way I explain makes sure that even after your deposit empty bottles/deposit of cash/loot you THEN pull out specific amount for refill and voila should be a perfect Cirlce ;)<br />

I will try it :D The truth is I wasn't careful enough and now I know the consequences. BlackD Proxy is very good bot if you know how to use it.</div></div><hr />

That's all good if you are 100% sure that the withdrawal was successful, but if there would be people blocking the way and you can't get to the bank-NPC, you might try buying something without cash<br />
<br />
A safer solution:<br />
<br />
fastExiva _mycash = $numericalexp:{$numericalexp:10000*{$countitems:E3 0B$}$}+{$numericalexp:{$numericalexp:100*{$countit ems:DB 0B$}$}+{$countitems:D7 0B$}$}$<br />
IfTrue ($_mycash$#number&lt;#$numericalexp:{$_manacostperpot$}*{$_mananeeded$} $) Goto $nlineoflabel:buy no pots$<br />
sayMessage hi<br />
waitX 1<br />
sayInTrade trade<br />
waitX 1<br />
fastExiva buy:$_manapotionid$:$_mananeeded$<br />
:buy no pots<br />
continue here...<br />
the parameters here are pretty straight forward I think</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive noticed in protection zones if someone is on the square I have scripted, he is able to walk through and through? I have never had a problem getting to the npc, I may be wrong on this one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-22-2012, 12:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I have released a new version of Blackd Proxy. It will display a yellow warning about high risk if you load a cavebot script containing one of the following risky actions:<br />
fastexiva buy<br />
fastexiva sell<br />
fastexiva &gt;<br />
<br />
It is up to the user to decide if he want to take the extra risk or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think Blackd doesn't send the hex in that case, as it displays a warning: &quot;Blackd Proxy is unable to sell that: trade window is not opened.&quot;</div></div><hr />
