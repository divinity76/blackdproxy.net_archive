I haven't tried it though. But according to others it works great. It's just that I'm not sure, if it works along with BlackD, cba to try it lul.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-06-2013, 12:46</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry, the programmer of tibiavrec disappeared, and I am afraid I don't have enough skill to update it.<br />
Anyways I recommend using a generic video recorder for Tibia, for example Fraps.<br />
The obtained videos are very big , but you probably divide the size by 10 if you recode them to divx or mp4.<br />
<br />
 - Maybe there are still some tibiacams out of there, but I would not take the risk.</div></div><hr />
