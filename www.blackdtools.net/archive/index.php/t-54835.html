This script has been remade for version 8.71 and using the latest BlackdProxy. Please note that when new updates come I will make sure to update and verify that no hex packets have changed to make sure it is safe and I will update the version number. Use at your one risk if you are using a newer Tibia version. 
 
What it does? 
Kills stuff that is found in Carlin sewers and goes to buy food and heal when needed. 
 
How to use it? 
Load the script and start in depot on ground" />
