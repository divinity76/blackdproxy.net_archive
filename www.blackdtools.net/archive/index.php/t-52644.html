I have been testing mine class for BMI (30 ppl). It's weight (50kg example)/tall in centimetres2 (1,7m2 = 2,89). About another part (the question) I think there are MANY diagnoses about BMI: one says 23 is fat and the next says 22 is really fat. There are different kinds of people and some may not think about it and rest may be seriously worried about their weight and lose it - what causes anorexia or other things.</div></div><hr />

The most important factor behind body mass index, which can affect it negatively, is definitely stress. Everyone knows how it affects the organism and i think it's useless to explain. Just relate what stress can cause and you'll build a strong network for your school job.<br />
Another one, and this one is a modern society problem, called fashion. That problem affects mostly young girls that want to be inside modeling and so. As you can see, only extremely slim gals have small changes to enter on those markets and seeking a way to look like them, some stupid people, adopt extreme methods to fast loss of weight calling on anorexia and bulimia.<br />

Sad but true. Had a friend on that situation...</div></div><hr />
