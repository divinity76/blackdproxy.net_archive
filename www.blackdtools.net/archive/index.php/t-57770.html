No bot will ever be 100% undetectable, people should keep that in mind when botting with any kind of bot program. Hell, even with Neo I know some cases that people were deleted and they said Neo was the most undetectable.<br />
<br />
If you care too much for 'main' account you should just manual, best way to be safe.<br />

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to 'advertise' or mention other bots here, so ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-12-2012, 16:54</div></div><div class="posttext">- All the cheats in Blackd Proxy are safe at this moment, EXCEPT the cavebot feature. If you don't activate the cavebot then there is no risk of automatic detection. But of course, cheating always have some risk: Players still can report you if they notice a strange behaviour.<br />
- Your main chars should not use cavebot and you better register your real info there in case you need to recover them in a hack case.<br />
- Your farmers can use cavebot, in a different account, with fake registration info. That way the risk only goes for them and your main chars will be safe as long you don't do cavebot with your main chars.</div></div><hr />
