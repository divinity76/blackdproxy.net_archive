<br />
People just don't use it as much anymore, since it's not &quot;guaranteed&quot; safe (what bot is?).  Anyhow, since the last 2 ban waves; I'm working 100% safe so far on 9 characters.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Bullshit. My RL got pwned. lol<br />
<br />
Anyways BlackD forums shouldn't be dead anyway we all know each other and should keep talking :3</div></div><hr />

neo is the safest nowdays.<br />
<br />
i never heard someone getting banned with neobot, untill now when xHellsx said that hes rl blablabla, lol</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Yeah even my RL thinks it was the manual hunting he did on the account that got it banned rofl xD</div></div><hr />

ofc its not 100% undetectable, but its the safest on the market for now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crille</div><div class="date">02-02-2011, 09:03</div></div><div class="posttext">ofc its not 100% undetectable, but its the safest on the market for now<br />
 <br />
Maybe so, but this generation of bots (keystrokes/mouseclicks = safety) is pretty much a hoax, albeit a smart move by ekx since naive users blindly trusts what ekx is promising<br />
<br />
It is however true that using keystrokes and mouseclicks provides more safety as certain errors are not possible, such as sending impossible or malformed packets, but to assume that it is completely safe for solely using this method to send packets is very naive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">02-02-2011, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using it and never got a ban with Neo. However its not 100% safe, if you use it only for basic functions, its pretty much safe.<br />
All the guys i know who were caught, used Elfbot/other somewhere in the past and only now are paying for it.<br />
Keystrokes/mouse-clicks are safe, since its the same method we use to play, as human beings. Hence, if you play with super uber fast speeds probably you'll get caught (Also MC users risk a lot).</div></div><hr />

An updated user agreement and some real efforts to catch botters would make neobot very easy to detect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">02-02-2011, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">To make the detection, Cip would need to install programs to detect what is going on client sided. And we know, from WOW, what problems does it bring and how easy is to bypass it. For now there is nothing attached to the client for detection.</div></div><hr />
