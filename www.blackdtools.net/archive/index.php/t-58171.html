omg man, im not newbie. Im telling you that i tryed to make many diffrent paths with many waypoint configurations but it always stuck in few same places. Its not fault of monsters but its fault of blackd and map. <br />
I would have to avoid +1 level and earn 10k less becouse nothing else then that helps.</div></div><hr />
