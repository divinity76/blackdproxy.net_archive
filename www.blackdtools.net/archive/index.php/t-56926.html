Hello ,<br />
We usually accept unverified paypal accounts now. However our system determined that it would be EXTREMELY risky to accept your payment. We are not here to lose money so we can't take that big risk. Please get your paypal account verified or use any other payment method. Sorry for the inconvenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-28-2011, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't give you a lot of details on that. The message is clear enough. With the information that our web collected, our records and your paypal information our system determined that it is very possible that you maybe will attempt to do chargeback with a stolen credit card, and that is no good for us. Risk of chargeback higher than 50% -&gt; unverified paypal account rejected. It does not mean that the system is 100% sure. It only means that the sytem think that it is EXTREMELY risky to accept your payment.<br />
<br />
If your credit card is -really yours- then just verify your paypal account. It should not be a problem for you in -that case-<br />
If you are unable to verify it then choose other payment method.<br />
If no payment method is good for you then buy the gold in other web.<br />
We are not here to lose money.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience,</div></div><hr />
