<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-30-2014, 12:05</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think the problem is other bot creators promise many fake things like safe cavebot and things like that, so people go there completely blind. <br />
The truth is... there are not safe cavebots nowadays. -If you use a cavebot you will always be deleted at the end. <br />
At least my cavebot is free. I don't like to lie people about safety. I don't want to sell a detectable cavebot. I guess being honest does not help in a bot business, but well, that is not my business anymore. I only focus in selling gold now.<br />
<br />
Anyways I have many safe tools (non cavebot tools) that are worth trying if you will play manual. And all my tools are open source so you can be sure we don't hack people here.</div></div><hr />

Is that something that can be easily detected? Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />
