Nowadays when botting I'm playing Need for Speed: World<br />
<br />
It's an MMO based on Need for Speed Most Wanted &amp; Carbon.<br />
<br />
The game won't shutdown your bots.(Unlike Maplestory.)<br />
<br />
So for the people interested:<br />
<br />
The game is free until level 10.<br />
<br />
When you reach level 10 you have to pay 20 euros/dollar to continue playing the game(forever, so you actually buy the game at level 10 if you like it.)<br />
<br />
You can download it here: http://world.needforspeed.com/<br />
<br />
Add me and we will do a private race :D<br />
Maybe some of you are already playing, here's a userlist:<br />
<br />
Blackd Name ~ NFS Name<br />
Rauisu ~ Rauisu</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: its nice but boring after 1 lvl up lol maybe better after more lvls</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is quite senseless... <br />
<br />
right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauisu</div><div class="date">07-28-2010, 03:13</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I preordered it cuz I thought it was worth it anyway.<br />
<br />
It's just like a trial if you buy it at lvl 10.<br />
<br />
But until now the game is kinda empti-ish and the game is instable because of the masses of people. Servers cant handle the amounts.</div></div><hr />
