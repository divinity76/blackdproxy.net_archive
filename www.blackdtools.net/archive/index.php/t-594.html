------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1.This shows what character the cavebot is botting with the script chosen <br />
2.This shows the script of your choice and all of its commands<br />
3.This shows how long (ms) it will pause before going onto next waypoint or contineing on, 1000 ms is equal to 1 second!<br />
4.To use this Fill in the space with the monster you want to kill, and ofcourse get rid of &quot;larva&quot;<br />
5.This chooses what you want to use, but you will have to use item &quot;ID&quot; a step to step guide is located here: http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?p=1059#post1059<br />
6.If you are afraid of something being luired on you and you have a backpack of HMM's set this option and fill in the blank with whatever monster you feel indangered of.<br />
7.If put into your script it will close on sight of a GM although it is not recommended since it usually results in a ban!<br />
8.OntrapGiveAlarm this command is self explanatory, if your trapped and cant move it will sound the alarm (alarm can be tested by saying &quot;exiva testsound&quot; in game window)<br />
9.If you are being pk'ed or being attacked by a monster not on your safelist, it will goto the line demmanded to goto!<br />
10.setAny will kill all monsters scripted, its default.<br />
11.setFriendly will only attack monsters not being attacked/attacking other people on screen!<br />
12.setFollow will follow the monster if it runs, or if your to far away, This is default.<br />
13.ongGMpause will pause ALL cheats/bots this is VERY HIGHLY recomended it is also recomended to always be near computer to hear the alarm just incase!<br />
14.onPlayerpause- this will pause all cheats/bots besides auto-uh, when a player comes on your screen!<br />
15.setVeryFriendly will only attack monsters attacking you, if a player is on your screen<br />
16.setLooton this will loot all items scripted, This is default.<br />
17.setLootoff this will stop looting all monsters corpses, if you want to make experience just a little faster this would help (tiny bit!:p)<br />
18.setNofollow this will not follow any monster if it is running or to far away from you, this is not default! and recomended for training scripts:)<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
1.This will script were you want to move, you do not have to do this every turn like other cavebots!<br />
2.This will use an item were you are standing, this used to be used for roped but now, it is no longer needed really.<br />
3.this will fish X times, great for fishing bots ofcourse!<br />
4.if this is in your script, when the bot gets to it, it will close your connection with tibia and the internet, great for bots that goto store change gold and put loot in dp!<br />
5.if it is in your script when the bot gets to it, it will pause for X seconds!<br />
6.This is very self-explanatory and will stack all items posible to stack when it gets to this line (recomended for fish botting)<br />
7.Ok so now youve scripted your bot to a diferent cave, but you want to change the loot? no problem put this in and after set new loot RED,5<br />
8.this will say a message in the default channel with what you want to say, great for scripts that change gold and goto depot!<br />
9.putLootonDepot, if you want to script your bot going to town changing gold going to dp and putting it in the depot this is the command for you, it will goto any avaible depot open it and put all scripted loot in depot!<br />
10.Getting heavy? if you put this on your script the bot will drop all your loot on the ground when it gets to it! but why would you do this? :rolleyes: <br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1.Ok this button will add the command you will put (the following steps)<br />
2.This is were you chose what it will react to EI, the default is mana so if your mana you can change to $mycap$ and others just check the events for more<br />
3. This tells the bot when it will goto specific line when the capacity (or whatever you've chosen) has been selected so for example number=&lt; meens eqaul or below notice the equal sign and the arrow pointing backwards<br />
4.This is the part were you actualy get to chose when the bot will react so if you want bot to go at 300 mana you put 300 there!<br />
5.This is were you can chose what line for the bot to go once all of the options are true!<br />
6.This is good for the ending of a script so it will continue forever once the bot hits this script it will goto (whatever line chosen) and continue on!<br />
7. this will goto the scriptline demmanded if you set this option on, remember to set ID and the amount of the item aswell!<br />
8.if you dont have enough items it will goto the demmanded scriptline this is great for advanced fishing scripts!<br />
9. add a title to your script just so others no? im not sertain sorry!<br />
10.MOD PLEASE I DONT GET THIS!  <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1. problem with one of your lines? edit it!, highlight the line and it should go into that box, change it. and save it!<br />
2. This shows all your scripts and enables you to choose one!<br />
3.If you added scripts while the Proxy was open it will not go on the list unless this is pressed!<br />
4.when BLACK,2; is highlighted and this is pressed it will load the (.txt) file onto RED,2.<br />
5.Changes made? New script created? Want to keep it that way? Then click this![/COLOR]<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Dear mods, as you can see I dont know every little bit and theres probably plents of spelling errres (&lt;thats a joke)in there so if you could please fix it up with your almighty knowledge and skill I would be delighted and so would the people that dont understand this bot! <br />
*ENJOY!</div></div><hr />

&quot;stack items&quot; - collects all items on the same slots (The bot will do this automatically anyeways I think)<br />
<br />
-just found out that if ya hold over those buttons the proxy explains it-<br />
<br />
Anyways, could you edit the post so all the features are explained further, I dont understand the &quot;label&quot; thing... (Havent tested it out yet) hehe:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Webber</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 22:14</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe i new what gotoline meens &amp; i dont no the ones that arent filled in -waiting for mod-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenshin</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 03:14</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as far as i know: 1. If the following condition is true, jump to (5) line; 2. The thing it will check and see wether to jump to (5) line or not (like current mana, life, exp, etc); 3. The relation between the thing you specified at (2) with the thing you will specify at (4), like, if the thing1 is &gt;,&lt; or = the thing2; 4. The comparation you are making with thing1; 5. If the statement is true, will jump to this line. For example: IfTrue($mymana$#number&gt;#400)Goto 63; That means if your mana is higher than 400 it will jump to line 63. 8. Just a comment at the script (it wont be read by the program), so you can leave your credits or take notes about some part of the script so you know what it means quickly. 10. Works like a name for a part of the script, so if u want like to jump to it, you will just specify the labelname and even if u exchange its place it will still read it right.<br />
 Sorry if anything is wrong and feel free to point any mistakes I have made.<br />
 Hope it helped</div></div><hr />

<br />
setDontRetryAttacks<br />
<br />
Is it really very dangerous?<br />
<br />
Since: 18 Dec 2006 : Blackd Proxy 9.14<br />
<br />
- Added 1 new mode for cavebot : setDontRetryAttacks (not recommended) this will only send attack order once, and it will never send it again. If that order get lost in the way, then you will be left defendless against the monster. Only usefull for very rare scripts.</div></div><hr />
