<br />
I'd reccomend you train under desert dungeon there are plenty of places there.<br />
<br />
Also stay off the pskjonne top online list most people exiva people off that :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demise</div><div class="date">02-24-2012, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Entrance to MoLS behind the level gates (with high enough skills you can train on a monk thats not a summon).<br />
Facc desert (deep underground where noone but a lost noob will wander; summons and slimes, bring food, lots of it, ive heard stories of people leaving bots there for weeks at time). <br />
At one point i used to macro train on summon in the cave in thais with bandits (back when there was only 3 bats spawning there). <br />
Another place (altho known and I always check it when I go PK) is a small island located between folda and senja. You can reach it via the cave at folda.</div></div><hr />
