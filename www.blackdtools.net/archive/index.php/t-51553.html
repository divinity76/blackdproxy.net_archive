Indeed its not. It also gives you a good idea of who can go first in a trade possibly. If someone has 100+ posotive feedback of course he could go first compared to a guy with only 1 posotive feed back. It gets your rep out there and your rep is on the line. If you look at someones feed back and they have a lot of people saying they got scammed etc.... then you pretty much know either be cautious with the trade or don't trade with that person.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Well if they made fake accounts to try and make them selves seem trustworthy you would most likely be suspicious because of there post count. It worked great with the other site I used, so I don't see how it wouldn't work here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zoidberg</div><div class="date">07-21-2010, 00:35</div></div><div class="posttext">just a suggestion only people with a certain number of post could post on youre feedback signature. so we aint the pages with all scammers spam!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telk</div><div class="date">07-21-2010, 00:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Or each IP could only have 1 account.</div></div><hr />

Those are both good ideas. Lets hope blackd checks it out.</div></div><hr />

Yeh, let's hope we can work out a system that will help the community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This can start to be the best forum. We just need to create a system were everybody can trust, and this might be the soluction for that.<br />
<br />
we can check everyone even before talking to them. and that reduce alot of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tony32</div><div class="date">07-22-2010, 03:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it aswell, but it should be a minimum post limit on your acc to be able to rate or what it will be called. Otherwise scammers will create noob accounts and rate themselves.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
yes that was I said, only people with a certain number of post can vote on another friend feedback (friend or client).<br />
<br />
<br />
imagine a guy with 100 post can start giving feedback (100post = senior member = low people comes to this stage)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jules</div><div class="date">07-22-2010, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a great idea.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seisuke</div><div class="date">07-23-2010, 01:44</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a genius idea o.o! Why couldnt i think of it?! lol jk<br />
<br />
  If anyone knows basilmarket.com from maplestory and wants to explain how it works we could have something similiar to basilmarket.com but for tibia where you sell items,gold, and/or accounts. Or we could just use their feedback system.<br />
<br />
Instead of having a link from your signature to a thread  tat shows your feedback, feedback could show up on your profile like beside your name to reduce amount of threads. Negative is the bad feedback obviously and positive is the good feedback.<br />
                         eg. Seisuke (0)<br />
                              Seisuke (-200)<br />
                              Seisuke(+ 1000)<br />
<br />
From there click on the feedback number to go see what comments there were for that person....<br />
<br />
 hmm yea... just an idea rofl oh yeah and my other idea<br />
<br />
Have like a certain format for ppl selling accounts like:<br />
<br />
in the topic say S&gt;Level / Vocation / World or Type of World ( Open, Optional, etc) / Payment types (in game gold/cash (IGG), Paypal (PP), Moneybooker? (MB) forgot name xD, bank transfer (BT), etc / If its transferable or not (T or NT) / etc premmy and what not<br />
<br />
this way from topic name you can tell if seller takes ur mode of payment, premmy , transferable, etc without looking at the thread or waiting 1 day or more for a reply. Would speed up trading process</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crossfire</div><div class="date">07-23-2010, 06:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Negative is the bad feedback obviously and positive is the good feedback.<br />
                         eg. Seisuke (0)<br />
                              Seisuke (-200)<br />
                              Seisuke(+ 1000)<br />
<br />
I think we should throw people off and do it backwards :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DoodeR</div><div class="date">07-23-2010, 06:46</div></div><div class="posttext">@seisuke - Yeah I used a site markeedragon.com for my wow trading etc.. but only paypal verified members were able to leave posotive/negative/neutral feedback. Or maybe set a certain amount of posts for that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seisuke</div><div class="date">08-02-2010, 23:57</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm dunno where to post forum ideas when we have them so Ill just post here.<br />
<br />
We should have a New Members section where they can introduce themselves or what not and any posts in that section not count towards your posts.</div></div><hr />
