Today, I went to school. I learned that I am fucking up in accounting class because I have been missing a lot of assignments since I was falling behind.<br />
<br />
I made fun of my best friend because he has &quot;dread bangs.&quot;<br />
<br />
I got yelled at in Physics because I was eating really hard taffy at my lab table.<br />
<br />
What did YOU do today?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright ill go on yesterday then as its half 7 in the morning now.<br />
<br />
Yesterday i woke up at 05:30 becuse some drunk guy was mad and screamd really loud outside,  so i got really pissed of becuse he woke me up that early so i screamed out of window for him to shut the fuck up..<br />
Later on the day me and some friends playd some basket but i was really tired so i wasn't for any use, so i went to the couch instead and watched some tv and later on feel a sleep. :p Then i woke up now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">08-02-2010, 13:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 months of vacation by the way ... School starts at 1st September here ...<br />
<br />
Today I woke up at 07:45 AM and then checked my two accounts that were botting over night (gladly both were still online with nice profit), then I've waited till 08:00 AM when there was a server save so I reloged my chars and now they're botting since then ... Then I had my breakfast and after that I went rope jumping for like 40 minutes (great cardio workout, even better than just running), I kinda achieved 40 minutes range of rope jumping and after jumping with a rope I grabbed some weights and pumped my body up ... after that I took a shower and then grabbed few carrots from our garden and had a little vegetable meal and now I'm here ... In like 30 minutes I'm heading to my summer work place, which is cashier at the mall (pretty good for 2 months of work) ... And after I'm back at 09:00 PM I'll jump rope for another 40 minutes ... <br />
<br />
Oh, I kinda described what I'm going to do today, but oh well ... Oh yea, those two accounts will be botting all the time since I'll be gone for a work ...<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
