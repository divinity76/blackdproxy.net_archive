Howdy! Short and simple. I've been using BlackD Proxy for a very long time now, but for the last 2 years my accounts were being bombarded constantly during ban waves. Now I've decided to check once again how easily is BlackD Proxy detected as an external program. 
 
Here's my set up:  
1.) Botting at cockroach cave at the beginning part of tutorial island. 
2.) It kills cockroaches, but it doesn't loot them. 
3.) Cavebot timer is set to 300ms -&gt;" />

3.) Cavebot timer is set to 300ms -&gt; 300ms.<br />
4.) 'Auto Chase Off' is disabled in General options of the client to avoid unnatural walking.<br />
5.) Frame limit in Graphic options of the client is set to 10 FPS.<br />
6.) I'll bot until I get banned or whatever.<br />

I'll update this frequently. To let you know how it goes of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niniots</div><div class="date">11-17-2013, 19:28</div></div><div class="posttext">5 days ago there was another ban wave. I didn't really pay that much attention since I've stopped botting this one 3 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Today I've decided to continue and this greeted me:<br />

Seems like BlackD Proxy is highly detectable, not even a simple script (look at my first post of Cavebot section) like walking around cave killing monsters (without looting) MUST NOT be used unless you want your account deleted at the very next ban wave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Randomiser off? You mean Cavebot timer?<br />
<br />
And what's up with macro? What would that mean?<br />
<br />
I'm willing to take these two you pointed out into consideration ... I'll just do another project then ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">11-23-2013, 15:19</div></div><div class="posttext">the timer is the random amount of ms between x and y and since you are setting them same max/min there is no room for variation of activity. (like in a macro)</div></div><hr />

I see, it's my fault then. 100ms-100ms makes it quicker of course.<br />
<br />
Would it be okay, if I set it back to 300ms-700ms? It's a default of BlackD Proxy cavebot. Or should I even higher those numbers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the bigger the spread the more randomisation so the safer.. But I guess anything too high would result in slow/less efficient botting</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see. I'm taking this into consideration. I'll open a new project shortly. A basic one for now. I'll try to bot daily for a few hours until the next ban wave. Let's see what happens with a randomizer. :)<br />
<br />
350 ms -750 ms ... This shall be my new Cavebot timer.</div></div><hr />
