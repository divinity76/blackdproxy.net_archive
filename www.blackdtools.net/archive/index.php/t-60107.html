	<meta name="description" content="Can anyone tell me the best setting for healing section in BSC? For example I've been using 1000ms delay between every healing and sometimes it didn't heal fast enough when i was hunting huge amount of creatures. As we know self healing cooldown is 1 second so it should work fine unfortunately it doesn't. What about setting lower delay? Won't it freeze your moves while healing? If you have any sugesstions post here thanks in advance." />
