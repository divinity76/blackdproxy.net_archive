<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doan916</div><div class="date">06-27-2011, 00:24</div></div><div class="posttext">its pretty equal to be honest. the amount of time you spend training equals the amount of exp you could have gotten. But, for me, I like to get good skills if not decent skills. I have experienced a character with okay skills hunting at turtle island and it takes forever to kill those turtles, while they just gang up on you and damaging you. Other players with great skills just roll up to each turtle and bash them quick and then move on to the next, stealing all the exp. It is really all up to you. I just mainly do it to get on the high score board. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dmoney</div><div class="date">06-27-2011, 00:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point and I have had the same experiences with an un-trained knight vs a trained knight. But when you get into the mid 80's the skills start taking to long to get. It's just been a long time since I've played so I'm wondering what I should do with my EK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">06-27-2011, 01:46</div></div><div class="posttext">You got training dummies at high level so you can just do 24/7 there and skill later on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blade</div><div class="date">06-27-2011, 07:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a level 90 pally with 104/87 without armor and with armor i am 108 dist I get 210k exp an hour solo in zao with enchanted spears. no stars no bolts or arrows just enchants<br />
<br />
to me training is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frog</div><div class="date">06-27-2011, 07:47</div></div><div class="posttext">a tip is to stand at dummies when you have nothing else to do. i've done so with my paladin for the past 2 years and i've got 118 dist :). totally worth it.</div></div><hr />

totally feel you on that one, just holy hell it takes so much time. id love to use a bot its just the risk and various other things.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Even with bots, I don't have the time. And when I had the time I didn't have the patience.<br />
I meant I'd pay for someone to skill a char up for me =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zKad</div><div class="date">07-01-2011, 01:50</div></div><div class="posttext">In the early days skills used to mean a lot more, but since the update of 2008 I think, at least for hits level means a lot more... Anyway my max on EK were like 95 training a lot to get that, really fucking boring even botting, since the development is so damn slow....<br />
<br />
Anyway I don't think it worth that much anymore, if someday I start another knight I'm gonna put him like 80-85 and just level...<br />
<br />
That's my 50 cents LOL<br />
<br />
See ya o/ :D<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
For paladin I think almost the same, but one thing at least 85-90 on a pally so you will have a lot better hit chance... at least that...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramo</div><div class="date">07-03-2011, 23:15</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been playing EKs on and off since I started tibia in 2002, in my experience at least what I did was get my skills to 85/85 at level 80 and after that I never ever trained on that EK, just hunted. By the time I go deleted on that char circa level 136 I had something like 96/91.<br />
<br />
On my current char I've done the same and now it's level 270~ with 110/92<br />
<br />
TLDR version: training is a waste of time, skills slowly increase as you level anyway and levels make you hit harder so just hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frog</div><div class="date">07-04-2011, 07:54</div></div><div class="posttext">advancing in skills increases your max damage mostly by 5hp, whereas levels at max gives 1hp but often 0hp. this applies to at least paladins, see tibia-stats.com and check it out yourself.</div></div><hr />
