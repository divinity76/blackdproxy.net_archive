Everybody knows that the program versions always occur 6-8 months before the actual year</div></div><hr />

trojan or backdoor differs from virus pograms, its more or less the same except for the damage, you should'nt worry at all</div></div><hr />

Lmao, Kaspersky is the best internet security on the market at the moment. Go to hell with Norton etc. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, NOD32 scored higher than Kaspersky did.<br />
But personally, I like Kaspersky better,  because of the User Interface.<br />
But still, I use NOD32 :)<br />
<br />
The three best Antiviruses:<br />
NOD32<br />
Kaspersky (A more user-friendly UI)<br />
BitDefender<br />
<br />
<br />
But if you want the maximum security:<br />
- Use proxies; such as FoxyProxy (for Firefox)<br />
- StealthSurfer (get the malicious put in a USB-stick than on your computer)<br />
- HushMail (an encryption e-mail; alot safer than Hotmail)<br />
- Do not have any ports forwarded on your router<br />
- Always have your antivirus up-to-date and scan every week (at least)<br />
<br />
And there's alot more security hints, but that's what I could remember at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Nymph.</div></div><hr />

Kaspersky is a good anti virus but its too pussy related with the programs you define as trusted...<br />
Blackd does not do anything because i've already mailled a few times and he always tells me the same, there is no virus on our tools (thing that i already know...) and dont even help us solving this situation.<br />
<br />
Also happens with blackd ping, music, and our most-famous MC.<br />
Why doesnt he edit the program so that error can vanish? <br />
<br />
Sad but true...</div></div><hr />

<br />
For your information with blackd you only ADD THE FILES Not replace the files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bodekkg</div><div class="date">05-08-2010, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Its getting deleted just after unrar. And I was talking about ADDING to trusted ones at kaspersky. And Im wondering how I can add the files that has got same name as files in tibia folder. I have to replace them lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-07-2011, 16:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I am tired of this kind of stupid posts, really.<br />
Blackd Proxy have communication components required for the license authentication and the generic antivirus scans thinks that a program is a virus only because having that.<br />
So you can safely ignore such virus warnings.<br />
