1. I start to drink at the same time as everyone else<br />
2. Trying to take it slow.<br />
3. End up drinking too fast and fall asleep ;&lt;<br />

<br />
One more: First time I got drunk I called my friends (phone) and said stupid things like &quot;Hello X! I am drunk now! And I haven't puked once!&quot; <br />
Do'h! &lt;.&lt;<br />
You guys just can't imagine how embarrassed I felt for VERY, VERY long :&lt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drazor</div><div class="date">09-08-2010, 16:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, annonymus eh? Oh well lol, i remember my first party when i was around 15, and the first time i really drunk pretty much. I was there with my best friend and i tryed to hook up a cute girl, the only problem is that i was drunk the very first time.. i remember saying something like &quot;why the heck cant i feel my lips anymore!&quot; while she wanted to kiss me.. (read well, she wanted - she didnt! cuz i was wondering why i cant feel my lips OKAY? lol) okay seriously, i couldnt look in her eyes on monday that was just way to embarrassing. Never talked again with her :P<br />
<br />
But well, thats not even the worst part.. it was around 10 pm where i was already completly fucked up.. and the next thing i remember is that i woke up in a park around 15 miles away from home, at 4 am.. opend my eyes, said what the fuck.. where the fuck.. right beside me lied my best friend .. he was sleeping there. <br />
<br />
Okay, the real bad point of this is still coming.. i was almost naked o_O.. so was he.. the first thing i checked were my balls.. the first time in my life i was happy they were full as a barrel! You cant even imagine how happy and confused i was at the same time. When i woke him up, he couldnt remember of much, he just remembered that it was very warm so we layed down and took of our clothes.. to be serious, I still hope untill today he didnt lie lol<br />
<br />
After this, I'm never going again to drink that much.</div></div><hr />
