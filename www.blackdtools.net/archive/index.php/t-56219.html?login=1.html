I also know people might still suspect me for scamming, and I don't suppose it'll do much to tell you once again that I'm innocent. The scamming occured right when I was let out of jail, and let's just say I had more important stuff to do than scam some shit from Tibia at the time... But whatever. 
 
What I came here to ask is if there are more people than me that's interested in &quot;Paid to&quot;-sites," />
