 <br />
Whether it's a proxy or not does not make a difference, as long as you don't send impossible packets or act unlike a human it is pretty much safe regardless of how you send packets</div></div><hr />

Is long time since anyone report me any ban because blackd proxy, but I better don't guarantee 100% safety yet...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I'll not bot on my mains yet, with packet based bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">02-15-2011, 00:11</div></div><div class="posttext">When BlackD lowers the price of the bot to the old 100ks I will renew my licence. No way I will pay 200ks with eminent risk of getting banned.<br />
He increased 100k's due to the introduction of safe cheats unfortunately they don't even get updated ... :/</div></div><hr />

Today, 2549 Tibia accounts have been excluded from the game for using unofficial software to play during the last couple of weeks. These accounts have been identified by our automatic tool. For this reason, complaints about these punishments are in vain</div></div><hr />
