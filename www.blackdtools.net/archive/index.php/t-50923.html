In vista even tho you are admin you still have to run as admin.<br />
<br />
In windows 7 the same probably applies but they've probably hidden the button somewhere crazy (fucking microsoft) anyway goodluck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">06-15-2010, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have the admin rights? Or do u share the computer with your family?<br />
<br />
If you do share and have multiple accounts try to run it on the account with admin rights. Usually father.<br />
<br />
I don't know this for sure, becouse I only using my own computer.<br />
<br />
EDIT!<br />
<br />
I'll add my mc here(since I couldnt unpack blackds Mc). It is opensource. So either compile it your self or use my build one.(Its up to you)<br />
<br />
About the program:<br />
<br />
It saves last tibiapath into a ini. <br />
Patch FullLight will make your tibia client run at full light all time.<br />
<br />
It do also restore orginal byte on mc address.</div></div><hr />

That's the problem I'm having, I can't extract the files into the tibia folder, it gives a failure.<br />
<br />
Any solutions? ;)</div></div><hr />
