Today I finally returned to Tibia (got free time now) and I tested this cheat. 
I can see that its very simple and judging from how it works it seems very safe. 
 
My first proposal is to have timed actions.  
As the name suggests this would be timed hotkeys. 
For example I want my character to use the Hotkey F1 every XXX seconds so it eats.. ( I guess it can be done if you set one option to be called if mana/hp is under 100% and then change the delay time, but a new option would be" />

<br />
Today I finally returned to Tibia (got free time now) and I tested this cheat.<br />
I can see that its very simple and judging from how it works it seems very safe.<br />
<br />
My first proposal is to have timed actions. <br />
As the name suggests this would be timed hotkeys.<br />
For example I want my character to use the Hotkey F1 every XXX seconds so it eats.. ( I guess it can be done if you set one option to be called if mana/hp is under 100% and then change the delay time, but a new option would be nice).<br />
This would not only help people make their characters eat, but if applied correctly it could be used to keep invisibility, haste, mana shield, etc.<br />
<br />
My second proposal (not sure if it has been proposed already, if so I am sorry for repeating) is to add more options for the mana and hp casters. <br />
It would be very useful to have options like mana/hp = XX or mana/hp &gt; XX. I figure that if its safe to detect when its less than it can also be done for these other options.<br />
<br />
My third proposal is to have an alarm for when a new character enters the screen. (I like to be afk while I do some runes, even though I still have to come to the screen to change runes xD)<br />
I am not sure how hard it would be to make such thing safe, but since it seems it isn't hard to detect the mana and hp I figure it wouldn't be hard to detect, safely, the battle screen. (hopefully)<br />
<br />
As you can see together, these ideas can pretty much function as a runemaker, except for the interaction that would be needed to keep blank runes at hand.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!<br />
<br />
Anxiously waiting for new safe features. ;)<br />
