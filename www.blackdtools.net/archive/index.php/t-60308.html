I have decided to play Tibia legit as it should be played on a PvP server with a little excitement, so far I have rounded up a team of 4 level 45 Mages including myself and hopefully a 5th if my Cousin re-news his premium account, so as far as that goes I have to say we have been doing quite well with our kills and having fun even with only two of us on at a time but I would like to see this grow into a PK Guild, where we are feared once we log in and people no longer run to come kill us in droves. This servers economy is booming, Premium scrolls sell for 800K+ and a single guild runs the entire server to profit from selling Tibian Gold. That being said, these people protect their money making business and I would enjoy seeing a team of low leveled, high skilled english speaking players dominating a Brazilian server. If anyone is interested in joining up with my friends and myself I would ask that you send me a private message and I will include details on how to contact myself and what server to start up your new character and begin offline training as soon as possible. <br />

Side note ; This is NOT a plan to take over a server, just to have absolute fun with PK Mages.<br />

Like I said we are currently just having loads of fun, unfortunately this becomes an expensive habit, everyone is expected to create a character and begin some form of money making with the amount of supplies, blessings, and random expenses add up quickly if you are interested please send me a private message and I will update you with our server to start up your first characters.<br />
<br />
Hope everyone enjoyed the Teasers, sorry guys haven't been around as much since the good ol banwave :&lt; Take care friends.</div></div><hr />
