 <br />
like the news said graphically its not done, but i like the hotkeys etc, needed for a long time and no the bots dont have to be rewritten we will still have good ol .exe as also reported in the article</div></div><hr />

wouldnt those things remain server sided?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">10-29-2010, 17:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine it will work like how when we level ingame our character doesn't get updated on the server sided website untill we log off/on again.<br />

So we would have the advantages until we relogged I guess.</div></div><hr />

Have you tried changing your level in-game? Or studied the protocol at all? Just because there'll be a flash client doesn't mean it'll become a single player game, so all sensitive data will obviously be stored on the server</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It should be obvious that the flash client is not meant to replace the client made in C++, I'm guessing the flash client is made for casual playing as the performance must be horrible compared to the native client</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jonesman</div><div class="date">10-29-2010, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">i guess this could make botting really impossible now</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Why?<br />
<br />
@my last comments<br />
<br />
Well other online based flash games are easily abused if made in flash...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ManInTheCave</div><div class="date">10-30-2010, 08:41</div></div><div class="posttext">If you ask me this is gonna make botting easier. Since Tibia will have 2 clients, we've got twice as much to play with. We could create our own flash client, and use it to play (effectively as a bot), and they might not do what they did to YATC to it... Or we could just continue the way it's going and use the whole Mouseclick situation... Of course you know about programs like GreaseMonkey, which edits websites... You'll probably be able to make a program using that, which plays for you.</div></div><hr />

idk maybe its harder to attach a bot into a flash thingy? idk :D<br />
sounds clearly for me but i dont have that much knowledge bout that ^^</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Why not just use the client made in C++?</div></div><hr />

yeah i probably will for most things, but i dont want to limit myself either, what if this new client actually owns and makes huge improvements excpet theres no maximized mode lol</div></div><hr />

Hm... not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Browser-based vs. stand-alone client<br />
Our current inhouse Flash client prototype is browser-based. You start your web browser, log into our website, click on &quot;Play&quot; next to one of your characters, then another browser window opens where Tibia is running. Making a stand-alone client in Flash is a possible way to go as well, but we focus on the browser-based version first.&quot; - Ogrey.<br />

That's so... RUNESCAPE!<br />

Omg, copying WoW and others big games is SOOOOO okay, but copying Runescape.. OMG...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
What's wrong with copying ideas if the result is a good one? This won't be a replacement of the C++ client, it will be an addition, and a very good one at that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">samzo</div><div class="date">11-01-2010, 14:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Are we still gonna b able to play like we play now. Cause it don't see anything good in the flash client</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">11-01-2010, 16:38</div></div><div class="posttext">It's great, still this can't be used on school computers/work networks as far i know since the servers is outgoing and my school network disable those connections.. well i could use Your-Freedom to gain access.. but still..<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s: When flash crash then what? lol or when people don't realize that updating flash needs all apps closed &lt;.&lt; gonna be a huge troublemaker!</div></div><hr />
