Anyway, I didn't want to write about tibia, because I no longer know much about it.<br />
What I wanted to write about is a card game called poker.<br />
I noticed the game is getting more and more interest.<br />
I have to admit that I've only been playing it for around 3 months but I've got to say I've really found it very entertaining and now it's starting to be profitable as well for me.<br />
I'm mostly playing cash games but of course I like to play some tournaments from time to time as well.<br />
I've started on a site called bwin.com and I deposited 15$ which I lost in like an hour or so, but then I got into reading some more about the game itself and since I love to gamble <br />
I deposited another 15$ and from that deposit I've not yet deposited any more money.<br />
I've started playing on the lowest stakes possible which are 0.02$/0.04$, when I made like a 100$ I moved to 0.05$/0.10$, made around 150$ there and then moved to 0.10$/0.20$ where I've played most of my hands(52k) which you'll see on this graph:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Recently(from 1st April) I've moved to 0.15$/0.30$ and I'm planning to stay there untill my bankroll reaches the cool 2000$.<br />
So far it's not going bad, although I've had some real bad luck as you may see on this graph:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
But my poker tracker says I'm making 8,5$ average on hour which I'm totally satisfied with.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I gotta say it's lots of fun and you're learning all the time. It's a great feeling to win the pot of 90$ with the nuts or to steel the same one with nothing.<br />
<br />
I wonder if any of you guys play poker anywhere?<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, there's a cool promo available untill 21 April, so I could send you an invitation if you want, you can read about it here. (https://home.bwin.com/friendswanted.aspx?view=info)</div></div><hr />
