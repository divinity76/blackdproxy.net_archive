As far as I know, it does not exist any timer functions, just $played$ that checks how long the player has been online. To create a custom timer, I am going to try to use the function $time$, a function that returns the current time in HH:MM:SS (string form). If I call the function in the beginning and the end of the hunt, it will be possible to calculate the total amount of time that has been spent at the hunt. <br />
<br />
My issue is that I do not know how to get the variables HH, MM and SS out from the string so it will be possible to do the calculation. If you have any idea of you can accomplish this, please post a comment! :)</div></div><hr />
