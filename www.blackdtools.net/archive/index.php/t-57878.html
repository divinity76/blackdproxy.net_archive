I'm playing on a OtServer and I'm trying to setup a hotkey that uses manafluids on myself. I tried to use exiva mana but didn't work of course because of different IDs. So I went to the 7.72 config and I tried to replace the ID for mana fluid. I found a line in the config called &quot;tileID_mana_potion=xxxx&quot;, so I changed it to the &quot;correct&quot; ID of the OtServers but for some reason it still doesn't work (after restarting both the Tibia client and the BlackD Proxy Client)

<br />
I'm playing on a OtServer and I'm trying to setup a hotkey that uses manafluids on myself. I tried to use exiva mana but didn't work of course because of different IDs. So I went to the 7.72 config and I tried to replace the ID for mana fluid. I found a line in the config called &quot;tileID_mana_potion=xxxx&quot;, so I changed it to the &quot;correct&quot; ID of the OtServers but for some reason it still doesn't work (after restarting both the Tibia client and the BlackD Proxy Client)<br />
<br />
The error message is: &quot;Can't find fluids, open new bp of fluids!&quot; even though I actually have a backpack of fluids open.<br />
<br />
I tried to do the same using the HP &amp; Mana section, didn't get it to work there either, the alarms started shouting and it said it could not restore mana with the desired recovery type.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

15:16 You see tile ID D6 07  with info  + fluidcontainer=TRUE + pickupable=TRUE + useable=TRUE + haveExtraByte=TRUE<br />
15:16 You see a vial of manafluid.<br />
It weighs 1.8 oz.<br />
<br />
it could be that the &quot;extra byte&quot; is changed, it should be 7..<br />
<br />
go Blackd menu -&gt; Cheats -&gt; backpacks -&gt; open 1 bp and put manafluid at first slot and reload list. and paste what it says here</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply,<br />
<br />
This is what I get from &quot;looking&quot; at the manafluid: 20:14 You see tile ID D6 07  with info  + fluidcontainer=TRUE + pickupable=TRUE + useable=TRUE + haveExtraByte=TRUE<br />
<br />
Cheats - Backpack: Container Cap 20/20 Contains: D6 07x7; D6 07x7; D6 07x7; .... (D6 07x7 20 times)</div></div><hr />

tileID_flask=<br />
should be tileID_flask=D6 07<br />
tileID_mana_potion is for newer clients (mana potions, not mana fluids)</div></div><hr />
