Tbh, they were planning for the flash client to be the 'big thing' for this update - but it failed on the beta tests so bad that they're pushing it a patch or two away. Funny, this update basicly has NO content what so ever.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this update is the one with lesser content ever. I would like to know that happened with the Flash Client that failed so hard that Cip is releasing it later...</div></div><hr />

Basic flash hacks could change your level to 100000000000000000000000000000 and 1 hit everything probably lol</div></div><hr />

 <br />
How come?? Those variables are server sided, so I doubt you could do that xD<br />
<br />
But if someone really did that.... then EPIC FAIL for Cip man!!!!</div></div><hr />

Lots of times Cip releases shit even tho everybody is whining about it, so CIP is known to be one of the best companies ignoring their customers lol</div></div><hr />

 <br />
At least Runescape is still somewhat popular... I bet Cipsoft did the flash client thinking they were going to make a huge hit like runescape? roflcopter</div></div><hr />

I logged in just to point out that your posts in this thread make you look fucking retarded.<br />
<br />
Go back to your room you stupid 12 year old and learn a thing or two before opening your mouth again.<br />
<br />
Anything you can ping can be &quot;DDOSD&quot; and your &quot;basic flash hack&quot; knowledge is amazing.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised you managed to figure out CE, too bad there's a tiny bit of knowledge required to use it. Not as easy as a full GUI Tibia bot. :p</div></div><hr />

Don't bother, I just logged in to ban you, because calling anyone, especially a Super Moderator, &quot;fucking retarted&quot; only shows how &quot;naive&quot; (using this to be polite) you are.<br />
Don't create another account and enjoy your 30 days away from here.</div></div><hr />

Other than calling you a retard, the other guy was completely right. The game wont be any more &quot;DDosable&quot; than it is now just because the port changes from 7171 to 80 and also the flash-client wont be hackable with &quot;basic flash hack&quot; since those hacks are client-sided, CiP are not retarded, they wont make mistakes like that :p</div></div><hr />

I'd say you're the naive one to believe that Moderators are superior to regular members.</div></div><hr />
