Anyway, I've wanted to train a bit my new moneymakers for the upcoming project, but Trainer seems like not to be working. To be exact, 'Stop attacking target until regen 50% hp' won't work! :&lt; It keeps attacking! &gt;_&gt; Could be that Trainer's default is a 'Monk'? Because I train on a 'Mad Sheep' though.

Any ideas perhaps? I've tried in combination with Cavebot, no success. Anyone else out there training at the moment that'd know how to set it up?<br />
<br />
All the help is much appreciated my little lemon drops! :3</div></div><hr />

I suggest making a seperate FACC to train with, bring food and set up conditionals to heal through out the afk train. Also include some sets of weak armor ex leather cap to reduce a few dps and less manas wasted. I find the best way for me is having a mage to summon two rats, attack the mage and the mage attacks your char needed to be trained and set your auto-eats and auto-heals, voila find a nice hide away for a good long time. If your PVE I am sorry I do not know what to suggest =(<br />

<br />
It's my first serious time on an Optional PVP though. Nothing serious, but a week afk could get me 80 skills which would be uber cool.</div></div><hr />
