LegerianOT is hosted in a dedicated server in France.<br />
The performance of the dedicated during beta is low to keep the costs down.<br />
The performance will be a lot better a few days before the launch!<br />
Also, if you create character during the beta days, it will be deleted before the launch!<br />
When the &quot;beta&quot; text in the header is gone, it's safe to create account/character without having them removed.(After April 30)<br />

About LegerianOT:<br />
<br />
LegerianOT started as a fun project in the end of 2013.<br />
The energy building this game have come from anger of botters and how nice it would be if a game could be without them.<br />
And without botters, the game doesn't have to be adapted to handling cheating players, etc limitations.<br />
If you plan to bot, we advise you to not, you'll only waste your time trying!<br />
<br />
Thanks to that we keep the game clean, we can reward players with powers as they level up, in another way than tibia.com does!<br />
Already at level 70~ here, you'll have the fire-power of a level 100 in tibia.com!<br />
<br />
Legerian is designed to be a game full of options, and things to do.<br />
There's hundreds of quests, and mysteries to explore!<br />
There are several areas that you need to get access to before entering, for example Okolnir, or why not Goroma?<br />
You can't just go there on demand, you must earn it!<br />
<br />
The best part, Legerian is certainly NOT a download&amp;run server!<br />
Actually even the sources of Legerian is to 70% made by Legerian Staff!<br />
We borrowed structure from TFS, a free version that had barely no functions in it.<br />
But that's exactly what we wanted! a source that had nothing.<br />
A good server isn't made of which one got most fancy functions.<br />
A good server is a server that have exactly the amount of fancy stuffs, that's going to be needed!<br />
Everything else is just a waste of space and in many cases, waste of CPU.<br />
<br />
The website of Legerian is too built from scratch by Legerian Staff.<br />
And thanks to that both game and website was designed/created by the Legerian Staff, we have the ability to fix and update things exactly like we want, as everything is written in our own code way!<br />
So we don't have to waste time researching how things works, we already know every inch of the whole game and website!<br />
<br />
And we from Legerian Staff, guarantee you a bug-free game environment!<br />
if you ever would come across a bug, you'd get rewarded for reporting it!<br />
The report system is unique and very easy and cleaver to use!<br />
You can see your previous reports on your account login, and you can also see if it have been fixed or not.<br />
You find all information you need about reporting things on your account-page.<br />
<br />
We also guarantee you to keep botters away!<br />
If you ever find a botter, don't kill him, report him!<br />
We take botter-reports very serious and will deal with that as soon as we see there's an report about it!<br />
But we in Legerian Staff hope you'll never have to report a botter, we hope we can keep them away from the game before anyone see them.<br />
