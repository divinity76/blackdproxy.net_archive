	<meta name="description" content="Hi guys. I have been lurking on this site for a few days now just reading about the tools available and reading some of the guides etc. I'm currently playing Tibia manually just to waste some time at work :p. I was really enjoying it until last night when I went too far into a cave and got killed by a demonic skeleton. I lost everything I had on me and really wasn't expecting it. 
 
Tibia is pretty unforgiving when it comes to dying huh? It's not exactly good at explaining things to you" />
