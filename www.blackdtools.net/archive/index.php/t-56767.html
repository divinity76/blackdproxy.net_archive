Anyways I think nobody can't change the following information in less than 30 days:<br />
<br />
- recovery key<br />
- personal information<br />
<br />
<br />
You might recover your account instantly through recovery key.<br />
You might recover your account in some days if you send a letter to Cipsoft office including a copy of your photo id card (the data of your card should match the data of your tibia account registration)</div></div><hr />
