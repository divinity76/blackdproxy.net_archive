im getting sick of the spam bots, and the persons that want me to make them a scripts, so here it is, my second script package!<br />
<br />
Old one can be found here (http://blackdtools.net/showpost.php?p=322318&amp;postcount=1)<br />
<br />
<br />
so the scripts are coming with a warning<br />
THE WARNING IS<br />
They might not work 100% properly. Like i said its an old package some script will have debugs and make u die, dont blame me test it fully perhaps on an OT server to be sure its 100% safe. And be carefull witch 1 u choose the necros target with hellspawn has a debug on targeting that im not willing to fix for free.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont ever download a file whitout scanning, and always ask a moderator to confirm its safe. As you know its from me you shouldend worry anyway but please no bullshit like theres hacks in it, or this is the last time i share anything whit u guys<br />
