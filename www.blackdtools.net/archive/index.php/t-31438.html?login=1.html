Some people say that it didn't happened before. I don't really know why they didn't warned about that before and why they do it now. Maybe some antivirus added some new generic virus patters to their databases. Maybe some 0s and 1s match with a new known generic troyan pattern for some weird reason, but I think there is nothing to worry. Blackd Proxy needs internet connection and needs to read/write memory.
