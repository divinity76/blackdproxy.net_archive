	<meta name="description" content="Hi, 
The older limit of Zaypay was 10eur/day. 
Now limit was raised: from 80 to 125 eur/day depending your country. This should be good news for all the people willing to do big purchases by phone. 
 
Another good thing: you can now purchase pins of 2.5 euros. This is the best option for people of Mexico. At least it is better than paying with pins of 1 euro. 
 
 
I also should insist that I recommend paying by paypal or bank transfer/western union instead phone. 
Paying by phone is very" />

Paying by phone is very expensive for you! Most of your money is wasted on the way (phone companies, phone taxes, carriers, operators, payment processors) That is why I should charge x5 price to receive the same I receive with other methods.<br />
<br />
Please only pay by phone if you have no other possible payment option in your town -or- if you have an outstanding phone promo.</div></div><hr />
