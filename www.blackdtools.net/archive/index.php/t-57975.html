Reading Tibia mana is not a simple task nowadays as it requires to handle ASRL and XOR encryption. Don't expect to read a few lines of codes here. It is a lot more of that nowadays. However I made it as simple as possible. 
 
The code is written in Visual Basic 6 (It probably won't work in newer VB versions)

Reading Tibia mana is not a simple task nowadays as it requires to handle ASRL and XOR encryption. Don't expect to read a few lines of codes here. It is a lot more of that nowadays. However I made it as simple as possible.<br />
<br />
The code is written in Visual Basic 6 (It probably won't work in newer VB versions)<br />
<br />
Note: This simple mana reader reads all the required addresses from the same config.int that Blackd Safe Cheats is using so in the future you only need to update the file config.int with a simple copy/paste from Blackd Safe Cheats updated config.int<br />
