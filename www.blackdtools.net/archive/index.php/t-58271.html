I bought gold from you yesterday with a world trade, and I entered the code to get 10% more gold and I gave 2.53kk on Calmera which should equal out (with the extra 10%) to 2.53k on Menera, but I received 2.3kk. Just curious if there was a mistake or is that code outdated or something? It is not a big issue or anything, mainly curious! But on another note, it was fast, easy, and I am entirely satisfied with the results!" />

Actually there are no codes for gold-&gt;gold trades.<br />
I guess you entered an outdated code or a code that was only designed for purchases with real money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it is because of this:<br />
 We can also accept cash of other servers, but not that big amount! Max worldtradable amount=445K<br />
<br />
I don't understand why you managed to do a 2kk+ trade...</div></div><hr />
