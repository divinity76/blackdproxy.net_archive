<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">01-24-2016, 18:50</div></div><div class="posttext">i just scanned the source code for SetMeleeKill , and there is no such thing :(<br />
<br />
very easy to change in source though, <br />
in modCavebot<br />
<br />
<br />
Public Function isMelee(idConnection As Integer, ByRef str As String) As Boolean<br />
  ' get the name from an ID<br />
  Dim res As Boolean<br />
  If cavebotMelees(idConnection).Exists(LCase(str)) = True Then<br />
    isMelee = True<br />
  Else<br />
    isMelee = False<br />
  End If<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
<br />
change <br />
<br />
  If cavebotMelees(idConnection).Exists(LCase(str)) = True Then<br />
to<br />
<br />
  If cavebotMelees(idConnection).Exists(LCase(str)) = True Or cavebotMelees(idConnection).Exists(&quot;*&quot;) = True Then<br />
<br />
now &quot;SetMeleeKill *&quot; would make everything a target! :)  i might actually make a pull request for this, i need it too<br />
<br />
edit: just did, see https://github.com/blackdtools/Blackd-Proxy-CLASSIC/pull/40<br />
<br />
and until its part of official blackd proxy, you can use this patch over blackd's tibia.exe , its 37.1 with minor modifications (the &quot;setMeleeKill *&quot; and fixed some 7.6 bugs and a bug with high exp ots and cavebot scripts now have their own folder in &quot;cavebot\&quot; and added $urlencode:str$ variable and some minor optimizations - most of it should be part of the next official blackd release anyway :) )<br />

<br />
I had a list in mind of a lot of variables (easy and harder ones to make) that I would be glad if Daniel implemented, but I wasn't sure if he was still taking/accepting proposals.<br />
<br />
I guess he still takes some on github though...<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll make a thread some time later with all the proposals.<br />
<br />
Btw, you're helping a lot the community, too bad it's kinda dead and/or with just &quot;readers&quot;.</div></div><hr />
