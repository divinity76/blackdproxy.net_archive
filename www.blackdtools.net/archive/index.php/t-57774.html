<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bougbear</div><div class="date">04-12-2012, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Been using Blackd since early feb time. Not sure what version, but might have been 22.4 or something? maybe earlier. <br />
<br />
I've been cavebotting since about the start of march,  I used the AdvancedRook2Main script on 8 accounts, and apart from that I've been using only Malmis' scripts, including:<br />
<br />
Venore Swamp Trolls<br />
Rookgaard tutorial<br />
Venore Rotworms<br />
Venore Orcs<br />
<br />
Not using any other bot. I was botting at the time of the mass banwave, and no characters deleted</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vacti</div><div class="date">04-13-2012, 00:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Banned using Blackd since about 3 month (client 9.4 I think) and fully botting with blackd and sometimes using other bots for healing (I think healing is not detectable on any bot). All scripts I used are from Safer Scripts.<br />
<br />
I haven't been using some of the accounts banned for 1+ month ago, then they know I were using bot long time before the mass deletion.<br />
<br />
The only think that makes me angry is not to reach lvl 60 on my rp, just 1 night more !!!!!<br />
<br />
Really, I don't matter about the banissed accounts I've already decided to stop playing tomorrow when my pacc ends, I realized it's very boring. <br />
<br />
Also, on 15th May I will be playing Diablo 3, since then I have exams to study:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minti</div><div class="date">04-13-2012, 10:57</div></div><div class="posttext">what they have in mind? it's fine that they erradicate botting(even if they are late), but this way they're gonna be a mmorpg with very few ppll playing and die<br />
<br />
noticed alot of xen~bot user's got deleted<br />
<br />
but not on red*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chuitox</div><div class="date">04-13-2012, 13:37</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you made this post for those got banned, yet I want to help you out with the analysis.<br />
<br />
Just to keep things clear, I DID NOT get banned/deleted on 2 accounts (1 facc, 1 pacc)<br />
<br />
- what is the lower Blackd Proxy version you used since last ban wave.<br />
I've been updating Blackd Proxy as soon as a new version is released. However, I've been testing the bot only for a couple of weeks (Exactly the amount of weeks Cipsoft has claimed to be analyzing players to give them deletion)<br />
- last time you used cavebot<br />
Same day of ban wave<br />
- tell if you was using any other cheat<br />
No<br />
- if you was only using 1 cavebot script always then please post the content of that script so I can analyze if this is a problem that only happen with some scripts.<br />
Simple script<br />
<br />
onGMpause #You never know<br />
setFriendly<br />
setBot OldLootMode=1 #Not always<br />
setLoot 00 00<br />
setMeleeKill Creature<br />
setPriority Creature:+10<br />
move x,y,z<br />
... #Many of these in the hunting place<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
<br />
Edit: typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-13-2012, 14:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you. Yes, I guess a basic script like that it is a lot safer than scripts with complex things, specially if they include custom packets (sending wrong bytes/outdated format=direct detection)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sucker</div><div class="date">04-15-2012, 03:37</div></div><div class="posttext">One account I botted with minimized backpacks and still looting (note this is impossible without a bot)<br />
<br />
I once bought 200 manas at once when i failed a script, this is also an impossible packet!<br />
<br />
This acc got banned!<br />
<br />
One acc i played with all open bps and clean depositers, no ban.</div></div><hr />
