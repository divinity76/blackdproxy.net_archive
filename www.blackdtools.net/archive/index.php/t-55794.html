Well, I just wanted to post, after all of these years in order to make you think: are you really playing tibia for fun or are you addicted to it? I was addicted to it, and I'm willing to give advice to anybody in order to quit Tibia, which is one of the wisest decisions you'll make in your life, if you play a lot of hours a day like i did.<br />

I know what it is. I've been exactly there, doing that. I think, the key is to realize that cheating is now not possible anymore, or not without consequences, and the best thing to do is simply quit.<br />
<br />
If you can't this way, you should just make your accounts innaccesible: change the mail to a yahoo/gmail/hotmail account. Change the passwords to a random generated password you can't remember, and change the mails pasword the same way. Make sure you wouldn't be able to access them anymore later.<br />
<br />
Eventually, try to sell the items/chars, but for RL money only (ingame goods only make the hook longer). But it is too hard, and you want to quit...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Yes. But then, people said exactly the same about 6.blah blah. That means, that they're allways fucking up things. You arrive to the game in one update, you have to learn quite a lot of things, and then 3 years after the game is totally different. If the spell words or manual loot weren't hard enough, now there are different attack types, different resistences, taming, skinning... it's simply ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Now that Blackd has just announced that he quits bot programming for RL servers I think it's the time for quitting tibia. Don't bother for OT, they are too crappy, slow, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I learned english I do not regret for the time I spent playing this game.<br />
<br />
OMG this topic was created in 2011. You could'nt image how the game got worse since then.</div></div><hr />
