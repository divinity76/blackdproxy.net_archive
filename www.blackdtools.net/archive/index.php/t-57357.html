Because when I'm fishing, I have to pause my script and go to another location and start it again; I mean I could write a full script with waypoints and everything, but since it's not recommended to use cavebot at all, I just use 2 of those commands: 'exiva pause' and 'exiva play'.

<br />
So, is there anything 'detectable' in that? I mean, is there being any detectable packets being sent to the actual server you're playing, when you're sending these two commands to BlackD Proxy, because red message appears: '14:19 BlackdProxy [255]: Automatic functions have been paused for this client - restore with exiva play'.<br />
<br />
I guess not, but I'd really want to get second opinion on that by more experienced BlackD Proxy user.<br />

Thanks guys! :)</div></div><hr />

Dunno why I ever doubted in its safety but still. Had that weird feeling about it, it's ok now :P</div></div><hr />
