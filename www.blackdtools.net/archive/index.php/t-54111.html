	<meta name="description" content="Hi guys, just wanted to ask if any of you know where or how to get a LICENSE KEY to this software: VDownloader Plus. 
 
For those who doesnt know, its a software that downloads stuff from youtube and sites like that. I know there are plenty of other softwares like this, but my mom uses it a lot and shes newbie to that but the &quot;non-plus&quot; has some features unabled :(. It's a good program indeed. 
 
So, if any of you can help me I'd be very appreciated. 
Thanks in advance!" />
