Well Lets Begin!<br />
<br />
Since vista includes its own partion tool we wont need any special programs (you will if you want to dual boot from xp)<br />
<br />
right click on computer and go to manage <br />
<br />
http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/4700/managenz7.jpg<br />
<br />
now right click on the drive you want to partion and select 'shrink partion'<br />
the space needed is for the xp installation since xp is about 1.5 gb full instalation i would make it between 1.5 and 2.5 gb<br />
<br />
<br />
now right click the unallocated memory and select new basic partition<br />
Choose NTFS file system this will save formatting before installation you can name it anything you like its usually 'xp'  <br />

<br />
<br />
once formatted you should have your partioned drives in a list usually looks like<br />
<br />
(C: ) NTFS<br />
Xp (D: )  NTFS<br />
<br />
The partion will be where ur xp installation goes. <br />
<br />
hope you enjoyed and if you want me to make a xp dual boot with vista tutorial just say ;)</div></div><hr />
