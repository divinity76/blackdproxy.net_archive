Although I would try removing &quot;Setvery friendly&quot; from your script as it may be recognising NON-REAL-TIBIA-CREATURES as players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&#1392;ow to do it? ; p I didn't never put SetVery Friendly mode into my script.<br />
<br />
When I doing my scrypt everything is fine. When I going to use my script everything is fine for about 5 minutes. After this time the bot stopping attacking monsters. Just it xd I don't really know why..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DroniC</div><div class="date">05-20-2013, 10:14</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm.. I will test it, but when I will add bot timer to 200-300 then bot will be staying on waypoint very long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DroniC</div><div class="date">05-20-2013, 10:15</div></div><div class="posttext">ahm. when I will put dont retry attack then bot will be selecting mob which is after the wall ^^ then he will lose target. so whats then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DroniC</div><div class="date">05-26-2013, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">still same problem. I don't have this problem only when I add attack monster by spell.. but it's just mana wasting. <br />
I think noone will help me.<br />
<br />
also the problem is... when I changing the time to 200-300 the bot staying longer on waypoint and long thinking about attacking monsters/open bodies. Just slower reaction for everything. <br />
<br />
is that a shit bot? I was reading that a lot of ppl has same problem.<br />
<br />
also when bot attacking monsters (if ^^) the bot walking little bit then bot is going to the monster ^^ <br />
<br />
yhm. shit ;/ <br />
<br />
<br />
someone from u have same problems?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read through this thread and I have no clue what your problem exactly is. Considering your script works for 5 minutes I was wondering if you let the script loop back to your first line after it finished the waypoints? I somehow have the feeling you didn't. I can't see the rest of your script though so I can't help you further like this.<br />
<br />
I never experience these problems so I think it's your script that fails here :/</div></div><hr />
