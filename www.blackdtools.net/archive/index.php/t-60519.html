The script was bugged and there were some mistakes in it, so I decided to rework it. You can check the original post for the features this script has to offer. <br />
<br />
What did I change:<br />
- script doesn't debug client anymore<br />
- some enters were missing in the lines<br />
- improved the overall structure of the script<br />
- added some monsters to the kill list<br />
- added new items to loot list<br />
- added health and mana regen conditions to the conditionals<br />
- when moving to Grizzly Adams it won't follow the monsters (this could cause you to get lured deep into the Tiquanda)<br />
- removed the avoid cave option since it hunts so fast through these caves that avoiding one is kinda useless<br />
<br />
This script doesn't make much profit, in fact I don't make profit at all atm. It does give good exp though (~25k exp/h). I used it to get the loot from Hide. It drops Knight Armor and Legs and I needed them. If you want to make money you should probably hunt something else like Rotworms.<br />
Keep in mind that you need a rope in order to run this script.</div></div><hr />

Thx for that report. I added a line too much at each condition. It's fixed now!</div></div><hr />

I noticed that problem as well, however I can't really fix it other than by rewriting most of the script.<br />
It will work if you start it at the Tiquanda (south side of Port Hope near Grizzly Adams hide-out) and not at the bank/depot.<br />
Make sure you set up $_counter$ and $_taskstarted$ according to your status. You can check how many tarantulas you have killed so far by looking into the questlog. Define $_counter$ as that number (you can do this in cavebot, these things can be found as some of the first lines at the settings label). If you started the tarantulas task define $_taskstarted$ as 1, if you started the Hide quest define it as 2.<br />
<br />
For example you started the quest and you killed 75 tarantulas:<br />
<br />
fastExiva _counter = 75<br />
fastExiva _taskstarted = 1<br />
<br />
Being fully prepared (100 mana potions and 30 health potions + rope) also helps alot.</div></div><hr />
