Ok, I want to continue with my project under 'botting projects' section but this error won't let me lol. I've tried everything and I don't know what I'm doing worng. 
 
It's working on OS Windows XP but it doesn't seem to be working on OS Vista. 
 
It's the same with BlackD Proxy as well as with BlackD Safe Cheats.

I dunno, there's more spam bots than real actual human beings posting on these forums. I'll pause my botting actions with BlackD Proxy for a while since I can't continue my current projects due to some BlackD Proxy error I can't, or better, I don't know how to fix. I'll be updating my project here on these forums for sure, just to share my experiences with you guys, even tho I'll be using some other bot program.<br />
<br />
Till next time, have fun botting mates! :D</div></div><hr />
