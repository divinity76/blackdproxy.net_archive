<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">09-19-2012, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">shannon, if your newer to Tibia, these are servers i DO not suggest.. I have heard the worlds are completely full, no spawns to really get your hands on especially because your so far behind now. and the PKing will be quite the problem for yourself! Maybe do a little research and find a quieter server. the new ones I think are going to be a little too wild for you.<br />

Just my thoughts,<br />

<br />
and a little note: This isn't a try to recruit peoples to start on aurora and attempt to rule the server, but if you're new on the server or played there for a while but don't know much peoples and want someone to quest with etc feel free to pm me ur name. But if ur new to tibia and pm me ur name and you got a million questions about the game or start begging for items i will ignore you ingame and on the forums.<br />
<br />
Reason for the note is some dude pm'd me asking if this was a attempt to rule the server.</div></div><hr />

Kinda sucks, now tibia is definetly past its prime it is getting harder and harder to find even a few people note-able to chat with on a server.<br />
<br />
Hope you find some people there.</div></div><hr />
