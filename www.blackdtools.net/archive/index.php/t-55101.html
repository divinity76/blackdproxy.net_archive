I'm mostly intrested in the 'custom' comands - I've made my script dig at a certain point and buy flasks. Now, I know there are some dangers you have to look out for when using those, since a bad packet is pretty much a garanteed ban. Any pointers on this one? I'm espacially intrested in the buy potions one, since it's one that you can't really do a refiller without. Is there a constant one in which you can edit the amount of pots you want it to buy?<br />
