	<meta name="description" content="I'm an old customer looking to get back into the swing of things but I simply can't afford to pay for an account right now. If you can add me to your BlackD account I can join your server and bring some power to your team. I then also can pay back the lender with money generated once I get the program again. Help an old tibia player get back into it. I'm also looking for a north american server where I could start at. If anybody has an idea please reply or msg me. THX guys:D" />
