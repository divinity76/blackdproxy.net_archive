<br />
Basically, lets just list sh*t we remember and see if we can build some interest. I'll Start:<br />
<br />
-Orc Bridge :) eventually turned into dwarf bridge, had 1 or 2 zerks at it and maybe some warriors. only thing north of it at the time was carlin and a few dragons i believe. Orc fort may have also been in the game.<br />
<br />
-Trapping the giant spider in cyc mnt by logging scout chars and having it spawn poison spiders :). once it was trapped, just log another char, pop up the hole, and shoot an energy field and 1 shot of an hmm at it :). <br />
<br />
-Also with giant spiders (moving diagnol through trees in poh and killing with low lv pallies), or firebomb trapping them, had to hit GS on center field tho :P<br />
<br />
-Tree trap pking by shooting a firefield when they were in diagnol trees. Also macro pushing PK'ing, Orio was the sh*t at this.<br />
<br />
-One of the coolest weapons in the game which was removed (maybed replaced with the carlin sword?) it was a sword weapon (the three bladed sword) referred to as the three blader.<br />
<br />
-When there was just &quot;tibia&quot;, no other worlds until the introduction of Nova and Premia. There was no existence of premium accounts either :P<br />
<br />
-Screen glitches (something we all don't miss) if you accidently pushed an arrow key too quickly following using stairs, a ladder/ramp, the screen would become totally f**cked.<br />
<br />
-Old energy bombs that were actually sweet. Fillind damn near the entire screen with energy fields.<br />
<br />
Well, I just wanted to try to get this started, and don't wanna make too long of a post that will drive people away, but i'll continue to add to this lil list, maybe this could be fun.<br />

Hence the reason I said shooting an energy field at it (plus 1 shot of hmm to gain all exp from the energy field damage). When killing with a paladin, the fire would just trap it because they would not run through the fire. <br />

i started tibia exactly on the update to 7.1 :D</div></div><hr />

Energy bombs would have been a waste, because this was at the time that energy bombs were only from spell scrolls, and the rune covered the area of a modern UE (with energy fields). But enough of the GS :P lets get on with some more memories of the old days. (Really looking from memories from the days before servers, just the good ole' classic tibia. <br />

<br />
Having blackd combo at 7.6 or so (that's when I start using bots for war - back then I used tasker to heal me - which was just lame but still) and watching a level 150 knight dying with 250+ (damage) sd flying together was orgasmatic.<br />
<br />
Runes flying were just a pyromatic show.<br />
<br />
It was fun to level up on dwarf guards when they were still at 190 or so experience.<br />
<br />
Was were fun. <br />
<br />
Annihilator was some sort of a challenge.<br />
Demon Helmet required skills. People would usually get someone to sacrifice himself in order to get the banshees killed. Tho, you needed skills to solo it aswell - Thats if you were 140+ (Altho I remember seeing some 110'ish soloing it back then aswell).<br />
<br />
Evizerate was Smoked which was a legend and then he was deleted.<br />
<br />
People used to think that Bubble was a so called 'god played char' - meaning that 'tibians god' used to play on it, altho I'm pretty sure whoever touched her would get banished as she was protected by unholy and unnatural forces.<br />
<br />
Well. Antica was Antica, Nova was Nova. Players from other servers would keep desiring to have those so 'rare' items - works for Amera and Premia aswell.<br />
<br />
Having a knight magicwall your ass would make you fall in the floor laughing hell hard. Ofcourse after you die with a 500+ exori.<br />
<br />
If you got hunted after a war 'without a payment for redemption' you would have to start over a brand new char, not just switch worlds.<br />
<br />
Well, its 11:10pm, I'm going to bed. If I ever get enough spare time again, I'll remember to post more here as there is hell alot of things that I used to love back then.<br />
<br />
Oh, the community who played that time was 10000x times better than the one who does now.</div></div><hr />

I think that may be the leading cause in &quot;this game sucks now&quot;. not that it was ever great, but what it is now is pitiful</div></div><hr />

It wasn't too big of a deal, but at least it added to the community and people cared about other things other than being the highest level. <br />
<br />
-Mages being able to summon dragons, and I can't remember who it was exactly, but someone summoned a nasty amount of drags at the magic carpet in femur hills and logged. (back when you logged, summoned monsters just became regular creatures). The mage was forced to kill all the dragons or be banned.<br />
<br />
-Spell scroll summoned a demon in carlin :)<br />
<br />
-The spell &quot;boadcast&quot; exisa mas&quot;, yeah thanks cip, I'd like my 400gp back since you stole that spell from me.<br />
<br />
-Duping items in crates in certain locations on the map during server saves. (never did it, not even sure if it was true, but i believe some chars were deleted due to it)<br />
<br />
-Just the general idea of making lv 12 pks with 60 clubbing and using a warhammer to pk with.<br />

<br />
- Orc raids in thais with 3457394857349 dead noobs, when 2 zerks were a challenge for almost anyone...<br />
<br />
- doing desert quest as 'help' on a high level, while another high level mate lures a few GS to the quests exit... 30k were never easier to obtain.<br />
<br />
- The looks of the old GS. now that was old school :D<br />
<br />
- Demons were actually worth hunting and you'd profit madly once you got some <br />
<br />
- Annihilator with manual UH healing as a knight - druids practicly couldn't make it till 180 or so...<br />
<br />
- BP's of UH's for 2k each at most. :D And tons of afk UH makers...<br />
<br />
- Broken or hidden quests and other secrets in general - I see less and less of those. Screwdriver for that dwarf, the dragons with the tp in spikesword quest, POI legend... All those gave the game some charecter which I feel less happens in today's Tibia.<br />
<br />
- Being able to bot 20 hours a day at scarabs. Who doesn't miss that? Damn stamina... :(<br />
<br />
- When Port hope was intreduced, hydras were a bit broken loot wise. I remember hunting them with 2 mages/4 Fire elementals, before loot drops were balanced. We made a few nice 100k's profits. All those skeletons/nub chars traps at the hydras staircase... :D<br />
<br />
- Slow spawns of single mobs. Back when I was a mid level [prolly low level nowdays XD 60-70], hunting in the black knight villa waiting for 20-30 minutes per BK, sometimes to get a piece of brown bread... Or the single demon spawn in Edron ...<br />
<br />
- Training on a ghoul deep down in MoLS or slimes in DDQ... Later it became Gargols behind the secret wall in tar tomb. [Today most people prefer the golems, I guess...]</div></div><hr />

When i first reached main, after 3 months in rook.. I got killed by jar jar obi, or something.. i think the char still exists, anyways. He was illusioned to a dragon and had a dragon summon, i totally thought for months i died by a weird named dragon... hahaha<br />

Another classic is bcing &quot;help hunter is pk&quot; hah..<br />

And the last one, but i don't think i remember right about this one..<br />

Maybe it was Nightmare? or Knightmare (I dont really remember the name) But he was a mapper at Cipsoft for a long time. He said that you should never kill a dog in Tibia or he or somebody will punish you.<br />

Something like that, not really sure about it either. I know I've read it somewhere..</div></div><hr />

also, did anyone abuse the beholder summoning skeletons to level mages back before wands were introduced and mages mainly hunted with melle weapons? we just had a knight block the beholder with a multiclient and we would kill the skellys as they mass spawned around the beholder.<br />

we used to also go deer hunting with LMMS just to dick around, back when shooting runes took slight skill before hotkeys.<br />

A clever friend of mine and his friend lured 1000's of dwarf guards out of their spawn and roped them up so they were all stacked in 1 sqm, and used a fire field rune on a single square so they wouldn't move. And in the end, he just used a SD in the stack and got shitloads of exp. Extreme profit btw :D</div></div><hr />
