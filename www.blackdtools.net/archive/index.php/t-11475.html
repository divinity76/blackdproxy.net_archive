Introduction<br />
<br />
Hello guys, welcome to my knight botting guide! I made this guide to help the newbies, but also the more advanced players/botters. I'll teach you the sophisticated and less sophisticated hunt spots for knights. In the past Knights were only usefull as blockers, now they can kill like any other vocation.<br />
<br />
Tibia.com's desciption of a knight:<br />
Knights are the toughest warriors in Tibia. They are strong, resilient, and they know how to wield any melee weapon with fearsome efficiency. In combat, they are always found in the front line, engaging the mightiest opponents in vicious hand-to-hand fighting. When they are travelling with others it is usually the knights who charge enemies in order to protect their companions. Because of their incredible resilience and their skilled use of shields experienced knights are almost impossible to overcome, and even if a battle is lost, it is usually the knights who are the last to fall.However, for all their prowess in combat knights do have a weakness: knights are comparatively weak when it comes to using magic. Even though they know how to cast a spell or two their magic is rather basic. For this reason knights rely on others to heal the wounds they receive in battle, often resorting to the use of healing runes which they buy from druids. However, this has never been a problem for a knight, because their ability to amass large amounts of gold is legendary. Strong as they are, knights can carry immense amounts of items which they can sell for good money in any city, so knights never leave a dungeon with empty hands.<br />
If you are looking for a vocation that is easy to play and to level up, the knight is what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanji</div><div class="date">11-02-2007, 06:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 8 - level 20<br />
-------------------<br />
Choosing the weapon class of your choice:<br />
<br />
Axe weapons: Preferred by most knights. They generally have a higher attack Value than defence value, but most knights have a shield with better defense value then their main weapon.<br />
<br />
Club weapons: Preferred by most sorcerers and druids. They are fairly cheap, but this low cost is offset by them being some of the heaviest weapons in the world of Tibia. These weapons aren't a great choice for a knight because they don't have much attack nor defense, and they weight alot...<br />
<br />
Sword weapons: The strongest weapon in Tibia is a sword. These weapons are very popular, used by any vocation (and even by non-vocation). Swords are the most balanced weapons for attack and defense.<br />
<br />
Although many players use two-handed swords because of their high attack and also high defense, if you have more than one monster attacking you, you will lose much more hitpoints than you would if you used a shield and sword.<br />
<br />
The leveling:<br />
<br />
Alright you've chosen for an axe or a sword (fuck club!), it's time to move to Port Hope Swamptroll cave. Here you will get a nice 6k-10k/h from lvl 8-15 or 8-20. I advise to move at lvl 15 to a Rotworm Cave either in Darashia or Edron, so you get more cash for equipment.<br />
<br />
Other way is going to edron trolls with a weak axe/sword weapon and bot there on defensive mode till lvl 15 for some skills. This way you will get way better exp/h at the next leveling stages.<br />

--------------------<br />
<br />
Congratulations you reached level 20, if you are on a non-pvp world you should do desert quest [10k+ ]. You can still bot at those rotworm caves, but now you can also move to Liberty Bay Rotworms for nice cash and 15k-20k/h experience. If you got enouph money, or Liberty Bay Rotworms is full you can go Larva's or Giant Spider Tomb or Peninsula tomb. Keep updating your equipment, with atleast a knight armor, dragon shield and fire axe/fire sword.<br />

-------------------<br />
<br />
I suggest unlike most botters to bot Port Hope instead of Laguna. In Laguna you can't go afk, for more than 4 hours, you need to go to depot for manas/uhs, that sort of things, there's many guys down there ---&gt; which will report for higher exp. So i suggest botting Port Hope at a steady 25k/h without manafluid usage, but less gold earning (0.8-1k/h). In Port Hope you can go totally afk, because there aren't many persons running around and you can't die there.<br />
<br />
If you really wonna bot laguna I suggest you to take the surface of Northeast and Southeast islands. You prolly waste to much at -1, or -2 or the underground caves are overpopulated. Laguna is more profit than Port Hope, but it is more &quot;work&quot;.<br />
<br />
At level 60 you can switch to Frost Giants who can be found on the isle of Tyrsung or Barbarians on Ragnir. You can also go to the overpopulated laguna, but not deep in the caves<br />
<br />
Now you should save up for BoH, DSM, MMS, Golden legs, aol, blessings (and addons?). If you are bored do some quest like scrapper arena, fire axe quest for extra cash. You can also manual Dragons for bigger profit.<br />
<br />
Scripts:<br />
1575 Lvl 30 &lt;--- 25k/hour<br />
1576 Lvl 60-65 80+ Skills &lt;--- 45k/hour - Desent Eq<br />
1577 Lvl 60-65 80+ Skills &lt;--- 45k/hour - Desent Eq</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanji</div><div class="date">11-02-2007, 06:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 80 - Level 110<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
Training<br />
If I would be lvl 80 i'd suggest getting some nice skills, so you can PG better. If you are on non-pvp use Gargoyle's or Slimes. In PvP try getting a monk, so you can skill up the fastest. I would suggest training till 85 shield, so you got like 88/85 or something, it doesnt matter.<br />
<br />
Leveling<br />
Now I suggest going to the Large Barbarian Camp (55k-70k/h), or Ice Witch Tower (80k/h?). You can still go to Laguna, but it sucks due to overpopulation. Another place is Banuta or Stone Tomb past coin. Banuta is definately worth going, it's a big moneymaker<br />
<br />
Reminder: buy all the blessings, the money isnt worth losing a 500k- 1kk exp when dieing.<br />

--------<br />
<br />
Now you should really do some quests. Especially Pits of Inferno Quest, Demon Helmet Quest, Warlord Arena and if you think your ready for it Annihilator.<br />
<br />
Annihilator can be made &quot;easy&quot; at level 110, but I advise you to wait until level 120. I also would only go with a team consisting of 2 or 3 Royal Paladins.<br />

----------------------<br />
<br />
    * From now on you should be able to bot Dragons! These will give you a nice profit and 90k/h. If your on non-pvp I suggest you to go to edron drags, because Venore Drags will be full with newbies. On pvp-worlds, pa everyone out of venore drags .<br />
<br />
    * You could still bot witch tower, or move to Malada, the city of quaras,... where you also get a nice 110k/h.<br />

---------------------<br />
<br />
You can choose between 3 things: Okolnir; Frost Dragons (140k/h), still Malada (120k/h) or Edron/Venore Dragon lair (Dragon Lords + Dragons).<br />
<br />
If you want to manual, you could still go Frost Dragons/POI/Demona.<br />
<br />
For PoI and Demona, I'd recommend a sio'er (mc druid).<br />

<br />
I would say 60-65 Skills no waste.<br />
Its just slimes/terror birds so if you can take a cyclops or 2 at a time pretty easy. This script is perfect. Those are the only hard things on there but there not even that hard lol.<br />
<br />
You can probably even do it with 55 skills and not a HUGE waste but probably some but you should get money back to fix it hopefully, depends on spawn time etc.<br />
<br />
Also maybe nicer eq other than a p set. Such as bright sword, cru helm, crown armo, k legs, boots, vampire shield. That will be so perfect. If not that P set, medusa shield, cru helm should be possible but I would go with the 60-65 skills if this.</div></div><hr />

Ya its pure profit but not much. Don't get a whole lot of cash. Like 1-1.5k cash an hour but no waste. So thats profit ;D<br />

I let mine thread close down, so it would b only available to people who know how to use search. Than those Huntspots will be less than 95% populated ;). Than some random choob copies the thread to blackd where it gets bumped day after day. Without even giving in the beginning proper credits, even know he's acting like he put some work in it, which he didn't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tibia Player</div><div class="date">04-27-2010, 21:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Started reading and gonna give my comments,<br />
ment to be CONSTRUCTIVE critics, i don't want to insult you or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 30 - Level 80<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
I suggest unlike most botters to bot Port Hope instead of Laguna. In Laguna you can't go afk, for more than 4 hours, you need to go to depot for manas/uhs, that sort of things, there's many guys down there ---&gt; which will report for higher exp. So i suggest botting Port Hope at a steady 25k/h without manafluid usage, but less gold earning (0.8-1k/h). In Port Hope you can go totally afk, because there aren't many persons running around and you can't die there.<br />
<br />
If you really wonna bot laguna I suggest you to take the surface of Northeast and Southeast islands. You prolly waste to much at -1, or -2 or the underground caves are overpopulated. Laguna is more profit than Port Hope, but it is more &quot;work&quot;.<br />
<br />
At level 60 you can switch to Frost Giants who can be found on the isle of Tyrsung or Barbarians on Ragnir. You can also go to the overpopulated laguna, but not deep in the caves<br />
<br />
Now you should save up for BoH, DSM, MMS, Golden legs, aol, blessings (and addons?). If you are bored do some quest like scrapper arena, fire axe quest for extra cash. You can also manual Dragons for bigger profit.<br />
<br />
Scripts:<br />
1575 Lvl 30 &lt;--- 25k/hour<br />
1576 Lvl 60-65 80+ Skills &lt;--- 45k/hour - Desent Eq<br />
1577 Lvl 60-65 80+ Skills &lt;--- 45k/hour - Desent Eq<br />
<br />
<br />
I made the experience (atleast if you start a new char and don't got full rare set yet) that you still waste manas/healthpots while killing terrorbirds cause you sometimes have badluck with:<br />
Running in 3 birds.<br />
Meeting shield breakers and the Birdies<br />
or last but not worst meeting 2 mother slimes and maybe even a bird.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Also its hard to get profit at level 60 on dragons,<br />
tried it with my ek with full rare set and 85/85 stats ;S<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tibia Player</div><div class="date">04-27-2010, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Quests<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Now you should really do some quests. Especially Pits of Inferno Quest, Demon Helmet Quest, Warlord Arena and if you think your ready for it Annihilator.<br />
<br />
Annihilator can be made &quot;easy&quot; at level 110, but I advise you to wait until level 120. I also would only go with a team consisting of 2 or 3 Royal Paladins.<br />
<br />
Annihilator:<br />
<br />
1564<br />
<br />
Pits of Inferno:<br />
<br />
1565<br />
<br />
I haven't done warlord arena yet on a real server, but aint it harder for ek than annih ?<br />
I think waiting for 120 there would be better as well.<br />
