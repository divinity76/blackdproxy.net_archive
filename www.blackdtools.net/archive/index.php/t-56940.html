<br />
Ensure you have changed the CORRECT version for the configs! (SD ID)<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly there are options in the magebomb module to attack either directly or to battle list? Try changing between the two.<br />
<br />
I'd always reccomend putting the runes in hand/arrow spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">martin1337</div><div class="date">01-02-2012, 17:13</div></div><div class="posttext">there is only an option to shoot trough battlelist. maybe there was another option in older version of blackd but im using 21.6</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">01-02-2012, 17:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you set &quot;antiban mode&quot; to 0 in the setting/configs?<br />
<br />
Also try going into the cheats module and setting in the big green box to the highest &quot;waste&quot; setting so that the runes do not have to be selected directly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-03-2012, 11:32</div></div><div class="posttext">is also possible that your ot server decided to disallow attacks in the first seconds after login, just like real servers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">martin1337</div><div class="date">01-06-2012, 21:52</div></div><div class="posttext">i did everything u said and u can sd directly when u log in but its still not working. but it must be the battlelist thing since u cant shoot in battlelists.. its the only option too<br />
<br />
Btw is it possible to use some kind of aim leader combo like u could on NG? so i can use mcs and sd</div></div><hr />

There used to be, was like Settarget: NAME<br />
and on the MCs you would allow &quot;follow this command&quot; but I think it got removed along time ago, check the cheats module for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">martin1337</div><div class="date">01-06-2012, 23:05</div></div><div class="posttext">its actually still there and it works :) its pretty nice except you have to write their names to shoot them</div></div><hr />

Its the same install as the new one, you change what client your using after opening the bot at the advance section.</div></div><hr />
