I guess this topic is similar to many others but I haven't found any satisfying advice while searching @ this forum. 
 
I've recently come back to Tibia after 3 years of break so I'm kinda confused and I feel like I don't know anything about currently meta-playing. 
 
I started few days ago and at this moment my character is: 
Royal Paladin 
62 distance fighting 
46 shielding" />

I guess this topic is similar to many others but I haven't found any satisfying advice while searching @ this forum.<br />
<br />
I've recently come back to Tibia after 3 years of break so I'm kinda confused and I feel like I don't know anything about currently meta-playing.<br />
<br />
I started few days ago and at this moment my character is:<br />
Royal Paladin<br />
62 distance fighting<br />
46 shielding<br />
EQ: Crusader Helmet, DSM, K-Legs, BoH, Medusa Shield (took it from my old knight)<br />
<br />
At this moment I hunt stone tomb (the first level after scarab coin teleport) and I get around 25k exp/h and profit 4-5x cash I spent for spears etc.<br />
<br />
Are there any other places I can hunt equally or more effective? I play mostly for fun and I don't wanna get bored too easly. If You know any good hunting spots or some complete and &quot;fresh&quot; paladin guide - post it here please ; )<br />
<br />
