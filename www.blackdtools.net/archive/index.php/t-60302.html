I've recently discovered that blackD sends packets not possibly sent by the client (or just bad ones) to servers. How I noticed this is that I'm playing on an ot server were they autodetect, what they say: unknown packets. <br />
<br />
I've researched about the problem what's causing blackD to send bad packets, and that is when you start a script far away from were the waypoints are. (the move x,y,z ones)<br />
How I know this is because I have a script in rook (just for banchecking) with normal waypoints near me. (No banishment) Then when I load a script with the exact same modifiers but waypoints far, far away like in kazz mines (from rook) I get almost instantly banned with reason (unknown packet).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure exactly what blackD do that the server notices, but I am 99% sure it's caused when trying to move to a far, far location.<br />
<br />
I've tested spamming minimap move via the client to a point far, far away. No banishment.<br />
<br />
Any ideas Daniel?</div></div><hr />
