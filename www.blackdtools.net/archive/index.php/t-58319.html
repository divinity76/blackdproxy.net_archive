<br />
Teaser time again! With this year's summer update, we are going to introduce a new premium feature to help you improve your skills in a particular field of your choice while you are logged out: offline training!<br />
<br />
Training schools will open up in all major cities in Tibia to give premium players an opportunity to advance the skills of their characters while being offline. You will be able to choose one of the following skill combinations for your training: magic level + shielding, distance fighting + shielding, sword fighting + shielding, axe fighting + shielding, or club fighting + shielding. You simply have to use the corresponding training statue in a training school to log out in order to activate offline training for your character.<br />
<br />
Next time you log in, you will be informed about the time period your character has trained offline and about the skill progress it has made during your absence. The skill progress will be determined by certain formulas. Since offline training allows you to sharpen your character's skills more conveniently and without having to use resources such as food, it will be less effective than training skills online. Vocations will influence your offline training progress just like they influence the skill progress when training online.<br />
Here are some further interesting bits and pieces about offline training:<br />
<br />
    A character will only start to train skills offline after you have been logged off with this character for 10 minutes at least. While having offline training activated for one or more of your characters, you can still log in and play with a different character.<br />
    You will be able to train skills offline for a limited time only. Each character may train offline up to 12 consecutive hours. The offline training time you have left will be displayed in your character stats like stamina, for example.<br />
    Every second you spend training offline will be deducted from this pool. You will regenerate one second of a character's offline training time for every second you spend online with this character. Additionally, you will regenerate one second for every second you are logged off without using offline training for this character.<br />
    If you train offline and the training time pool reaches 0 while being offline, every second you are logged out without training will also regenerate one second of your character's training pool. However, to be able to use the regenerated offline training time, you will have to log in and use a training statue again. Let us use an example to illustrate it: Your character has 6 hours of training time left and you log out by using a training statue. You stay offline with this character for 10 hours. Upon login you will get the skill gain for 6 hours offline training and your training pool will have 4 hours left.<br />
<br />
The introduction of offline training will also bring along a change of one of the rewards for completing the Shadows of Yalahar quest, namely target dummies. Target dummies have been a controversially discussed feature ever since they were implemented. We want to address the feedback we received on this topic by removing target dummies from the game and providing offline training instead, a convenient way to sharpen skills which is available to all premium players.<br />
Consequently, Telas' laboratory will be cleaned of target dummies with the summer update. Players who completed the Shadows of Yalahar quest will then find some gnarling creatures down there, and a special tool to ensure that they leave the room on the back of one of these hairy beasts.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, we will upload some fancy artworks featuring the Gnome theme on our official Tibia Facebook page. Also check our supported and promoted fansites for translations of this teaser.<br />
