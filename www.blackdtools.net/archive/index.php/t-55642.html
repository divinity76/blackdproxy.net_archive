<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doan916</div><div class="date">06-19-2011, 13:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I would get at least magic level 55 or 60, so that you don't completely waste your money and time hunting. Then, since I'm a Kazordoon type of player, I usually go to the big Dwarf Guard Spawns in Kazordoon and hunt them in packs and usually gfb them when needed or wand them solo. That should get you to like level 60ish, and you could continue hunting them, but I think the exp would slow down. I'd probably hit up some dragons in Edron, Venore, or Yalahar afterwards or you could also try some Ankrahmun Tombs (after portal-deeper levels) use gfb/ava to kill the packs. Those 2 options should bring you to like level 80isd +/-. From lelvel 80, I'd buy Sds runes from players or npc since your rich and hunt frost dragons til like level 100+. From there I think there's plenty of great places to bot your level 100 druid but I don't know any. Pretty much that is what I did on my druid which had magic level 60 at level 30. I got it to level 100 in like 2 months max if not less, and then sold it to some dude for Real Life Cash. I hope that helps. I don't know if this is the best way to hunt, but I am and old school player, and this is what I would do. Max you'd be spending is maybe 1kk if not less.</div></div><hr />
