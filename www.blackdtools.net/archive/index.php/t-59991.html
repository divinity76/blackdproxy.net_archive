Second question being regarding Shovel Holes ; <br />
<br />
This is a very random question but lets say for example a random item such as a gold coin/potion bottle/barrel are placed on top of the shovel hole of your cave. How would you script, moving that item off every time BEFORE trying to shovel and enter the cave? Now as a side note, is it going to send a bad packet if you aren't moving that gp coin or barrel if it is no longer there?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help in advance,<br />

<br />
<br />
anyways I should warn that Blackd Proxy cavebot does not perform good for high levels, and there is no distance fighting option. Only melee.<br />

<br />
A sad face on the distance thing as well, but to be honest it is not too much of a problem, just a slight inconvenience.<br />
<br />
On a second note, I like your idea about the auto-pick up gp/bottles/labels and depositing them as well, very brilliant!<br />

If you don't mind using hexes, you can check which object is in the hole position (there is a exiva command for that) and then move it/pick it up using an exiva command. if done right, it should work with any item placed on top of the hole ;)</div></div><hr />

I am really curious on how the script WOULD look though as I am always thirsty for knowledge.<br />
