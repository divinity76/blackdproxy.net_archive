Perhaps I'll convert it to forum some day, it seems like too much work. Maybe when the guide fully develops ... I'm planning to add some more scripts.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd like to ask you for suggestions on what more should be added? Any kind of feedback would be much appreciated ;)</div></div><hr />

i think it's easier for everyone if you use variables, some people might not know how to make the coords in hex.<br />
<br />
quote from the site:<br />
<br />
fastExiva &gt; 82 67 7E DA 7D 07 60 06 01 00<br />
<br />
where the red are x, y, z.<br />
<br />
instead change it to:<br />
fastExiva &gt; 82 $numbertohex2:12345$ 7E $numbertohex2:12345$ 7D $numbertohex2:7$ 60 06 01 00 <br />
<br />
so they just have to edit it to &quot;normal numbers&quot;<br />
<br />
however, this might be really useful for a lot of people and it's a good idea.<br />
<br />
I never get such ideas to make this things :(</div></div><hr />

If you want proof it was made by me just make a quick search at the forum and see the date I posted.<br />

ok just found that the &quot;connecting conditional events&quot; was made by me too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it kind of simplifies things. My idea was that people will &quot;catch&quot; hexes through Proxy. It should be easier for most of them  to just input the coords.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

My idea is that just because you published something first, doesn't mean you have the exclusive right to be the author of it. That follower, &quot;stalker&quot; as you called it, alarm is 2-3 years old. <br />
<br />
Do you really think I could NOT do it by myself? Of course I can. Then why credit you? Just because you published it FIRST?<br />
<br />
Maybe I used the same variable as you? Happens, sorry. Perhaps I even saw you in your script long time ago and got used to the name.<br />
<br />
<br />
I promise you, I would never copy a script and post it on my website. <br />
<br />
I'm a good scripter myself, I can write what you can write. If you publisehd it first, doesn't mean I could not have figured it out on my own. <br />
<br />
Maybe I should credit you like &quot;alarm on follower script that was first published by Weeper&quot;?  I don't know, it doesn't sound to neat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No offense, I really respect you and I appreciate all the hard work you put into doing this script. BlackD community really benefit from having you around. Please try to put yourself in my situation - I'm able to write those scripts as much as you can and now I'm expected to credit you just because you published them first.</div></div><hr />

Here's your answer. It could be found on my site all this time. You need to find for yourself what the hex string is for any given place, using the Proxy window and Log Packets function. Read more about finding hexes on pro-tibia.com in Cheating section.</div></div><hr />
