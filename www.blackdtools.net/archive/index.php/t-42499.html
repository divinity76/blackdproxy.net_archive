The source was leaked, npcs, maps, the whole nine yards. I had wrangled a copy of the thais npc's off of someone yet thats all I could get, those that had it kept it well secretive. I no longer have the NPC data as that was years ago, I've changed computers since then and saw no value in it at the time. However there would be advantages to having that. Sorry thats all the info I have!<br />

On TpForums somewhere, I think it was Ian who posted an example of an NPC. It basicly sucked. The way our programmers (talaturen etc.) does it is way better ..</div></div><hr />

Indeed it would be, PM me your msn Webber, I have some propositions and ideas I'd love to discuss on this with you.<br />

&quot;what&quot;,&quot;do&quot;      -&gt; *<br />
&quot;gold&quot;           -&gt; &quot;You have to slay monsters and take their gold. Or sell food at Willie's farm.&quot;<br />
&quot;money&quot;          -&gt; &quot;If you need money, you have to slay monsters and take their gold. Look for spiders and rats.&quot;<br />
&quot;rat&quot;            -&gt; &quot;In the north of this temple you find a sewer grate. Use it to enter the sewers if you feel prepared. Don't forget a torch; you'll need it.&quot;<br />
&quot;sewer&quot;          -&gt; *<br />
&quot;equipment&quot;      -&gt; &quot;First you need some armor and perhaps a better weapon or a shield. A real adventurer needs a rope, a shovel, and a fishing pole, too.&quot;<br />
&quot;fight&quot;          -&gt; &quot;Take a weapon in your hand, activate your combat mode, and select a target. After a fight you should eat something to heal your wounds.&quot;<br />
&quot;slay&quot;           -&gt; *<br />
&quot;eat&quot;            -&gt; &quot;If you want to heal your wounds you should eat something. Willie sells excellent meals. But if you are very weak, come to me and ask me to heal you.&quot;<br />
&quot;food&quot;           -&gt; *<br />
&quot;heal$&quot;,Burning&gt;0 -&gt; &quot;You are burning. I will help you.&quot;, Burning(0,0), EffectOpp(15)<br />
&quot;heal$&quot;,Poison&gt;0  -&gt; &quot;You are poisoned. I will help you.&quot;, Poison(0,0), EffectOpp(14)<br />
&quot;heal$&quot;,HP&lt;65     -&gt; &quot;You are looking really bad. Let me heal your wounds.&quot;, HP=65, EffectOpp(13)<br />
&quot;heal$&quot;           -&gt; &quot;You aren't looking really bad. Sorry, I can't help you.&quot;<br />
&quot;time&quot;           -&gt; &quot;Now, it is %T, my child.&quot;<br />
