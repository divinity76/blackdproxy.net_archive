What kind of server is Iridia?<br />
Iridia is a real-map based on the best data package, that is available to download for free. This might sound like we have just downloaded a server and launched it, but we assure you that we have put in alot of effort to make Iridia exactly what we want it to be: a consistent real-map server where casual gaming meets RPG and where the thoughts of the players are being heard by the content managers.<br />
<br />
Will Iridia stay online?<br />
This is an excellent question and we are glad that you asked it! Unfortunately there are alot of servers out there who gets shutdown due to lack of interest from the owners or just because they are not making enough money from it. We can ensure you that this will not occur to Iridia, we are looking to create a long-term server where dedication among players and staff members are priority one! The long-term goal we have is to make Iridia sustainable for years and compete with the other top servers out there, with this goal in mind we hope you understand that we want Iridia to be perfect... We also have no interest in resetting the server.<br />
<br />
How do I get in touch with support?<br />
The best way to get in contact with us is to use the forum, however if your matter is more crucial or private you can contact us via mail. The contact information is available at the support page.<br />

Hail Iridia!<br />
