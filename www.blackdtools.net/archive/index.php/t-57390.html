I saw your scripts and they are really good. Unfortunately, since these are my last holiday's days, I don't really feel the need of playing. But yes, you have all my support. The more scripts you create the better for this community, since conditional events are tricky and hard to make. <br />
<br />
There's still some hope:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">02-28-2012, 23:52</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the problem with these forums. There are not many costumers around and the one's there are, are just in the trade section.<br />
But its growing. We just need a few more BlackD updates to make it more stable, secure and useful. Some new functions would make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
Keep making scripts. I would recommend a single thread with all the scripts you create. They would be compiled and easier to find. SOmething like the Lucas Terra script thread in Neo's forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not it only has one single color!!<br />
Monochromatic [.code][./code] hahahah<br />

See, there's still someone who cares about your scripts :D</div></div><hr />

I've found that it actually learns as you go along, cause I had my character to spin every time it got the message of 15 minutes. about an hour in it still gets kicked due to inactivity</div></div><hr />
