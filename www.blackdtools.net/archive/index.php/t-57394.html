UPDATES:<br />
<br />
 1&gt;2 Works better with setFollow on rabbits.<br />
 2&gt;3 Added SetMaxAttackTimeMs<br />
 3&gt;4 Added setChaoticMovesON after loading branches for Zirella, added setFriendly around Carlos and changed cap-check for meats from 13 to 1300 (Thanks x3 to zihinu)<br />
<br />
This script will automatically take your character through the Tutorial on Rookgard.<br />
It's pretty much just to login and start it, when you login and haven't configured the sex of the character you just have to write &quot;exiva _sex =&quot; and the sex of the character, male or female.<br />
This is need to not send the wrong packets to server.<br />
If you don't want to have to set it up manually every time, maybe if you are botting many characters in a row or using it as part of a bigger script, just change the &quot;fastExiva _sex = no&quot; line in the textfile.<br />
There is also an option that under where under the third part of the tutorial, when gathering food for Carlos, you set it either to gather as much as it can carry (about 21 meat) (&quot;fastExiva _moneymaker = 1&quot;) or exit the isle as soon as it can (&quot;fastExiva _moneymaker = 0&quot; default mode).<br />
<br />
KNOWN BUGS:<br />
<br />
 Can stand forever and kill cockroaches because of their respawn and no way from cavebot to stop it. A conditional event could be used.<br />
 Always tries to turn in Zirella's quest after putting in only one branch, no decent way of putting a check to stop this.<br />
 The messages from the bot sometimes turn up on Default if you don't manually close windows. Most won't mind.<br />
 Can not use either Shovel or Rope right after looting because they are &quot;glowing&quot; when looted. Can be changed by having BlackD proxy identify CB 1E as Shovel and CC 1E as Rope.<br />
<br />
<br />
To not get the eternal cockroachkiller bug you should use this conditional:<br />
<br />
$countitems:CA 1E$<br />
#number&gt;#<br />
2<br />
0<br />
500<br />
0<br />
exiva ignore<br />
What the bot will say:<br />
<br />
If you haven't set the sex it will first say:<br />
03:23 AutoRook [255]: Please enter the sex (FEMALE or MALE) of your character like this: &quot;exiva _sex = male&quot;.<br />
03:23 AutoRook [255]: The bot will not start until you do.<br />

03:23 AutoRook [255]: If you have not already done so, you may set the sex of the character you want to bot in the Automated Rookgard Tutorial by Malmis.txt,<br />
03:23 AutoRook [255]: then the script won't pause for setting the sex, but the AutoRook messages may appear in the default channel unless you manually close windows.<br />

Apart from that, worked fine! it's nice to be able to set stuff up easily. Eagerly awaiting your full rookgaard script</div></div><hr />

Try version 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&gt;.&gt; For me it's just silly annoying tutorial CipSoft made and I don't see any point of doing it. I mean level 2, rope, shovel, maybe some cash collected trough selling meat/hams, but that's it, all this can be done on rats on actual Rookgaard island.<br />
<br />
But, that's just me lol :P Gratz again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malmis</div><div class="date">03-02-2012, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things you should change in the script.<br />
<br />
1. setChaoticMovesON after done with Zirella's quest.<br />
<br />
2. setAny / setFriendly after :huntfood. It won't kill the Rabbits because Carlos is there and setVeryFriendly is still there from before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will try it a bit more and tell you if I find more bugs.<br />
<br />
Thank you, I was going crazy not figuring out why it suddenly stopped attacking them. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Also: When $mycap$ = 13 it's actually 0.13 oz. Should be changed to 1300.<br />
This was changed by blackd a while back (half an eternity) when cip introduced the decimals in the capacity.<br />
<br />
Yes ofcourse, thanks. It was a few years since I scripted, altough that had been introduced I just didn't remember. :p<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
'Cause I got high, 'cause I got high, 'cause I got hiiiiiigh... Seriously.<br />
I also was a bit WTF in the morning, why did I waste 6 hours last night creating sometimes that'll always just be a novelty. :P I was thinking of making the full quest but then I thought I'm not THAT high... And no sane botter would ever accept having to wait 10mins for the tutorial then having to relog because of Kraknork's Demon, even tough just scripting to after that would give decent equipment with selling 20 meats to Carlos from tutorial and sabre from quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">03-02-2012, 13:40</div></div><div class="posttext">@Malmis ... But still, awesome work \o/ ... Oh yeah, about Rookie guard quest or w/e it's called ... I did it once, 2 days ago, cuz I needed kitchen knife, and I'll never do it again. I spent 1 hour doing it manual &gt;.&gt; I mean what the hell!!! Scripting that is a challange for sure, but NAH! don't do it xD, you'll go crazy, lmao ... In my opinion it's better to get some cash for easy equipment buyable from NPC and then just 'bot all the waaaaay' till level 8 and if possible choose a vocation on destiny island, that's it. There have been some srcipts around like that, but now they're probably bugged and full of 'unwanted evul packets'. :P<br />
<br />
I mean, how hard is it to skip tutorial and start script in a temple which in the end brings you to main without annoying quests? :D<br />
<br />
Of course, RPG players who want all the quests out there to be done, are the completely other story.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck on your next project, it'll kick ass for sure. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
RPG players wouldn't bot the quest anyways... :P And thank you for the praise to, it was actually alot of fun making it. And a great reminder to people what can be done with BlackD. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it's fun! It's a challenge! You learn stuff from doing these silly things. I've even thought about making a script for postman and desert quest.<br />
<br />
Postman and DD are ALOT more useful... ;p</div></div><hr />

I never said it was functional. In fact I don't expect any of my scripts to run at all - they are around 2 years old!\<br />
