Keep up the great work dude, Im curious what vocation/set you rocking? Id have to say my fastest levels were. Botting 1-22 ( 1 Day ) Been a long time since I tried to burn all my Stamina manually so I don't think I could even tell ya sorry bud!<br />

I'm knight and rocking a p-set lol! my skills are also awesome 49/47 LOL hopefully today i'll get level 30 and get a bright sword! my plan is to make as much as i can botting, then make a main character all by hand! thanks for the reply, appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-30-2012, 22:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck on that bud ! Always wise to start a main and whenever you make cash flow forward it all to that main bank. I use BlackD Proxy on all my accounts EVEN my main, but I only CAVEBOT on my FACCs. Hope that makes sense ^^ BlackD Is still great for the auto-eat and Auto-heals, you can even make the conditionals(!) a runemaker if you get the drift.<br />

Created a new account yesterday, according to my stamina and my exp/h I'll be able to get it to almost level 25, if not too many people will walk through my spawn, which they obviously will . So 20~? We'll see. :)</div></div><hr />
