	<meta name="description" content="Hello 
 
I just came with one proposal which could be implemented into BSC.  
CIP has changes anti-idle system and now spamming at NPC Chat, cast spelling or eating doesn't work. 
Is it possible to make new tool which can avoid anti-idle ?  
For example automatic pressing Ctrl+UParrow-and then-DOWNarrow between appointed time like 500-900sec. 
Or maybe there is another way to avoid new CIP idle system ? 
It would be very nice if you can think about those very helpful tool. 
 
Yours" />
