I playing on Anime Ots, which is named Dragon Ball Legend.  
I heard that some of ppl are using Blackd Proxy on this server. I would like to use this bot too, but when I trying to open the bot it isn't work. The bot just cannot find my character name...  Maybe is the problem with the OTS port, or something else. Also this server hasn't got a Tibia.dat files. This file is called D-B-L. dat. Maybe that's why it isn't work.  
The server is on tibia 7.6, but some files has changed names" />

<br />
I playing on Anime Ots, which is named Dragon Ball Legend. <br />
I heard that some of ppl are using Blackd Proxy on this server. I would like to use this bot too, but when I trying to open the bot it isn't work. The bot just cannot find my character name...  Maybe is the problem with the OTS port, or something else. Also this server hasn't got a Tibia.dat files. This file is called D-B-L. dat. Maybe that's why it isn't work. <br />
The server is on tibia 7.6, but some files has changed names ;) (like tibia dat - d-b-l dat). <br />
I'm not sure, but I think that the port of this OTS is 7172. Is it a any possibility of checking it? <br />
<br />
Does someone was testing BlackdProxy on Anime OTS like that? <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
