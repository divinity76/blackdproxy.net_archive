Ok, thank you.<br />
If you are unsure about the removal of that keylogger then I recommend you to format/reinstall windows. That always work 100% <br />

No, i got kinda worried that you would do such a thing so i looked around a bit and found the .exe that caused all the comotion. I found it and deleted it, im now risk free. hopefully.</div></div><hr />

I am a computer repair technician now and fosforo is correct. Sometimes they lay dormant.<br />
Also their are other benefits such as better computer performance in general. Along with more free space on your HDD by wiping out all the temp files and cache files that are left over from program installs, downloads, uninstalls, etc.....</div></div><hr />
