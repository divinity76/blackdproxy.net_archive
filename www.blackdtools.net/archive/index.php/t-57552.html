I have a problem with the Cavebot module. When I am using cavebot, sometimes my char animation moves but char not. In some particular situations char just stuck on one sqm. If I am attacked by a monster I see &lt;puff&gt; on empty sqm (the one the char stayed before). When monster is killed &quot;char&quot; stays like 3-4 minutes on that sqm and then continue his route. Any solutions for this? 
 
Thanks in advance! I really appreciate your help!" />

(Haven't got that high character in 'rl' tibia so it probably never happend to me elsewhere other than on an OT)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I've seen a slight solution for this somewhere on here, it went like this:<br />
<br />
1.) Options -&gt; General -&gt; Auto Chase Off (checked)<br />
<br />
2.) In client itself make sure you disable 'chase opponent' next to fighting mode (offensive/balanced/defensive), make sure you got it 'stand while fighting'.<br />
<br />
Try this two, I've tried it and it kind of reduces stopping when botting on an OT, in fact now it happens very rarely. \o/<br />
<br />
Report back if that helped! :)</div></div><hr />

I always use Auto Chase OFF and Stand Mode instead of follow ;/ Tried almost everything - in the game client and in the bot itself. <br />
