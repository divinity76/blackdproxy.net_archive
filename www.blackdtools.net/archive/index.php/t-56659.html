<br />
Most likely hes using custom scripts with non of the old hex msgs being sent to server.<br />
He won't be using stupid scripts that people have set up to use rope on ropespot when blackdproxy auotmaticly reads and sends this information.<br />
I imagine he won't be sharing his scripts and not hunting the same thing everyday but different spawns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i create my own script.. i dont share it.. is true. hunting more than 6 hours day in fibula's rots with makers... i'll not post the namers bcuz anyone can read and bla bla bla.. but i use cavbotter in 4 makers and still runemaker... and too in my main char... but in my main i use only Hp&amp;Mana + runnermaker.<br />
<br />
you can believe... better for you if you create your own script.. dont download it from No one. BYE</div></div><hr />

I imagine that the automated system of Tibia, IP restrictions of the players, then who uses MC is a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MC as long as it doesn't alter the client is 100% legal. If you don't believe me try playing the flash client and normal client at the same time. POSSIBLE? OH NOES CIPSOFT MC!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
as blackd stated, u can use blackd safe cheats, or pay a monthly fee for neobot, which is really advanced.<br />
<br />
PD: my intention is not to advertise another type of bot or whatsoever.</div></div><hr />
