How is it racist, I cannot support people who are unjusting my level 7 characters 24/7 :P I can't even make it to bank to give them payment before they try and kill me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ryujin</div><div class="date">11-21-2010, 13:12</div></div><div class="posttext">Its general stereotype sadly. There are some cool Brazilians but a large number of them are very childish. The same can be said for every other country, but Brazilians get more attention because they rule alot of worlds :o</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Well judging all brazilians for something makes it racist.. Its not like Anyone asked you to throw money or support anyone before getting to know them.. So not giving some one a chance becuse hes br seriusly seems racist to me. but thats just me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stained</div><div class="date">11-21-2010, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, im still looking for an usa server to play. anyone? lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kvra</div><div class="date">11-22-2010, 07:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt consider that racist, BRs have made themselves hated on tibia by most people.<br />
 <br />
^ that.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;BR's&quot; are those who were born in Brazil. Therefore, there are no such race as &quot;BR&quot;. <br />
<br />

<br />
And, I'm a BR myself. Never felt offended by any kind of &quot;BR BR BR&quot; thing :-D</div></div><hr />
