Balanced Professions<br />
There are perfectly balanced professions on our server. We have spent many hours with tibia calculators to make all runes and spells exactly the same as in RL.<br />
We want to make game more dynamic so cooldown for spells such as ue and waves were reduced when there is more then 10 players on your screen. experience stage is increased.<br />

There is also Daily Quest.<br />
<br />
<br />

There is fully working Quest Log (with missions), almost all your done quests and missions will be noticed here.<br />
You will find also for example information how many monsters you have killed in every mission of Killing in the Name of Quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monsters<br />
We edited loot &amp; attacks &amp; hp of more then 600 monsters to make it exactly like in RL! Loot has been made anew, completly from nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids<br />
It is the next huge advantage of our server. We have prepared almost 60 raids based on RL Tibia! Raids have been made with such details as for example when Orcs Attack: Carlin, Thais or Femor Hills you can loot from one Orc Warlord a part of the Amazon Set.<br />
