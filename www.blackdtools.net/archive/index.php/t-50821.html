i was testing what happens if i spam in default, filled it with a single letter spam, put it in a hotkey and to send automatically and held the hotkey, i get kicked in few seconds (isp long timewithout responde from server from balckd) <br />
<br />
then i log in again and repeat the process, i get kicked in less seconds<br />
<br />
then i log in again and repeat, i get kicked in 3 or 4 seconds<br />
<br />

<br />
