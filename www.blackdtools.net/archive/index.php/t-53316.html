 <br />
Some CM answered a lot of questions on the topic. You can't mount on PZ and I don't think it will effect PvP or PvM.<br />
<br />
<br />
Omg unique idea im pretty sure no other mmorpg has this (y)<br />
 <br />
Yeah lol, they pretty much copied 3 WoW mounts and 1 from Ragnarok.</div></div><hr />

This guy has a link in his comment, his comment also adds nothing - I'm quite sure he is just a spam bot. But I haven't banned him, if any other mod could have a look would be nice.<br />

Most games copy ideas and its great, but when your go from unique game with great features to shit game with regular features... You've gotta ask yourself should you continue to integrate your product or differentiate it into something new good and fun!<br />
