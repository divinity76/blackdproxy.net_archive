I've been trying out a OT that uses 7.72 config, and I can't seen to get UH healing to work. Also it would be so great if blackd could be used to auto drink mana fluid on character, and eat food. I've been trying some exiva commands I found here on the forum when doing a search, but I can't get it to work at all. 
 
Anyone feel like helping me? :) 
 
Edit: I do apologize if there already is a thread discussing the matter. Thruth be told I couldn't get the search on this forum to work" />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nas</div><div class="date">04-21-2012, 05:03</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to mention: I did change to config file to the right IDs, however, it still doesen't work. I've been searching around for some time now and found that people using windows xp have had better luck then me on the subject. Could it be a compability issue? <br />
<br />
Also when I run blackd as admin the rope DOES suddenly work, so it's prolly safe to say that blackd IS reading from my 772 conf file. Still, UHs and foodeater wont work =/<br />
<br />
Also read some random thread with a guy saying he solved the problem, but he never mentioned how...Dont u just hate that? xD</div></div><hr />
