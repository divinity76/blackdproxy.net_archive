<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">02-03-2012, 01:59</div></div><div class="posttext">so.. you basically remade good'ol TibiaPW from 2005? :p<br />
<br />
anyway.. this program requires a &quot;license key&quot;, wtf? x.x<br />
<br />
(also i stumbled across your servers' license key repository in search of a keylogger/account stealer/ function. even though encrypted/obfuscated/hashed/whatever-it-is, there's a huge flaw in your current license setup :p)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xongiver</div><div class="date">02-03-2012, 14:48</div></div><div class="posttext">What is wrong with license setup? It works good, I sold few licenses so far, ppl didnt had problems with that.<br />

Btw, source was checked by moderator of XenoBot, compiled and uploaded by him so you can consider it as safe.<br />

If you would like to check how this program works I can give you free 5 days for tests.<br />
<br />
<br />
so.. you basically remade good'ol TibiaPW from 2005?<br />
- No. I didnt know about it at all, I made whole source by my own, sometimes asked for help with functions on autoit forums.<br />

- If you checked it I would be thankfull for statment about keylogers free software.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">02-03-2012, 17:34</div></div><div class="posttext">taking into consideration that the licenses are bound to a specific hardware ID; i take it back. im sorry,<br />
it was not a *huge flaw* as i originally though. however it should still be fixed..<br />
The list over all licenses, as well as their content, are publicly viewable. the list does not require a password, all you need is the url. i sent you a pm :p</div></div><hr />
