	<meta name="description" content="Hey Guys, 
 
I see that there has been a post stating that Black is highly detectable, and some ban posts below.  However, from the individuals using this bot day in an day out, have you been able to continue to bot on RL tibia with success?  I'm currently using Xeno (Started to play again and Black wasn't updated) but I've always been a BlackD user and prefer it.   
 
So what's your opinions guys?  Should I use Black to bot RL tibia or stick with Xeno?  Thanks!" />
