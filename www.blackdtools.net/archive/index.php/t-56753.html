	<meta name="description" content="I was wondering... How SAFE are safe cheats?? All i really want is the auto-eat and the anti-idle. I want to know how undetectable it is. Like has anyone here only used safe cheats and got caught/banned/notation? Also i wouldn't mind having an answer to... How safe is the normal part of the bot? I used to use it and it worked for a while but i ended up getting banned after a while on like 2/3 of my accounts. 
If anyone can reply to this that'd be great =)  please and thanx" />

BlackdProxy is not safe, and with the new cavebot it probably isn't even worth using as your character runs around like a moron doesn't loot half of things, might just forget that it was attacking something and run away or decide it loves fire and run over the same field 50 times! haha</div></div><hr />
