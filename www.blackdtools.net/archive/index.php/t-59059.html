Anyway this is in the WRONG SECTION. So NO. Don't post in the wrong section!</div></div><hr />

It takes up to 3 minutes to make a decent script. Oh and if you want a depositer and 100% afk. Well invest 20 minutes... And then you can post it here and share? When noone else wants to spend 20 mins of their time? No...? I wonder why noone shares when noone can be assed to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">09-25-2012, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the same way before too Hells~ Even when I was paying for BlackD there was only a few decent scripts on the forum, probably Wiotki and a few other bigger names. I noticed once I started to use public scripts, my accounts were getting the definite ban, maybe from poor script writing I was a much bigger noob back then, I eventually sat down and read the forums and took initiative to learn how to script. I now have over 30+ FACC Knights that are atelast all 50+. It was a fun project, and all it takes is a little patience and some knowledge :) Good luck to you guys. ps a Little side note, once I made my own scripts, Ive never got another ban.</div></div><hr />
