The problem is it always has something to attack and is never able to go to the next line.  I decided to fix this problem by useing a conditional event that always checks if something is true but I cannot find the right action to make the cavebot goto the specific line.  Is there another way to do this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bebot</div><div class="date">11-11-2013, 06:02</div></div><div class="posttext">It is just a basic script but the cavebot's functionality does not seem to give me an option around it. The first line would just have a setMeleeKill in it but since it is always attacking it never can read a second line until there is nothing to attack.  The second line can be anything such as a move command that the bot will never move to.  I am trying to find a way that the bot can always attack but be forced to another line manually or just remove the setMeleeKill and attack some other way so the bot will be able to go to the next line.  It would solve all my problems if an exiva goto command could be added to the bot.</div></div><hr />
