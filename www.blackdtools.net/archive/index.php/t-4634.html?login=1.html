	<meta name="description" content="Remember old Ian's TPR? It had a function called &quot;master/slave&quot; that allowed somebody to have a basic control of somebody else's char without having their acc and password. 
This is done by text commands that a specific &quot;master&quot; tells to the char he's controlling (slave) 
 
I've made some events that allow some basic moves. I will add more commands as soon as I can. Make your requests about a command you want to be added and I'll see if it's possible to make. 
 
Load this event in the slave's" />
