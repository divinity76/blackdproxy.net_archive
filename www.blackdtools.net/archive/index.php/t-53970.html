The tool has a build-in auto updater, so when there is an update he will ask if you want to download it, if you want to do that manualy you can go to the website (http://tibiaskypealarm.sytes.net/tibiaskypecall/?subtopic=download)<br />
<br />
You need to install Virtual Audio Cable, with this tool you are able to connect output (music from Windows Media Player, of sound from the bot) to a virtual microphone, and a microphone converts it as WAV, when it does, the WAV sound level will be catched by the tool, and if there has been 3 (or how much you've set) alarms, it will call the contact name(SKYPE USERNAME!) or phone number (you will need skype credit to do so) to alarm you.<br />
