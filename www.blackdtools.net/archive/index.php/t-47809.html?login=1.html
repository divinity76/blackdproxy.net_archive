Did you ever wonder why CIP only ban few chars thats cheat, and not all? 
Why you had 40 accounts botting and only one got caught? 
 
It took me 2 accounts with deletion warning since I came back to tibia but.. it was worth I think. 
 
How I did notice it? Playing everyday with 5 accounts. 
 
When I started to play tibia again , I created 5 accounts, always following the same pattern." />
