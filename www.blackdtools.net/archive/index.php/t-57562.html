It needs to be efficient, good scripting without error. Needs to run away from target at a good distance. Needs to be worth the money.

I'd be interested, but I don't have any high level characters to script with. So I'd need to borrow yours.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also I've ever only seen one script that managed to run anything, and that was 'cause that dude was sick. :p It was cool but it was so much hassle. It needs to be redone every few levels because you're faster, and it couldn't handle lured mobs for example.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, on other bots there's been several different. Not so much in BlackD.</div></div><hr />
