So I wanted to request a conditional that drops something like 1 dragon ham right under me (or in front of me) every 8 minutes. I'd really apreciate it. Thanks in advance." />

<br />
exiva &gt; 78 FF FF 0X 00 00 $hex-equiped-item:0X$ 00 XX XX YY YY ZZ CC<br />
0X is the slot to move from and X, Y and Z's are the position to drop at. CC is the amount.<br />

Oh right, haven't played rl Tibia for a long time :p<br />
Anyway, he said it was for an OT so it might work.</div></div><hr />
