Ive been using this bot since 9.0 and ive never had any of my bot chars get banned i still currently bot while afk. I feel safer making my own scripts since i know what they do and what they are suppose to do. I think it is safe to bot afk aslong as you have some pots and auto heal youll be set for aslong as you have stamina :D</div></div><hr />
