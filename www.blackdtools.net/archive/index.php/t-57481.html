I still keep an eye around so please behave nicely!! 
 
Btw, I didn't post this in the main thread when I saw it days ago, but now is the time: Welcome back Malmis, I remember you as one of the best Scripters around way back in the days :D 
 
It's great to have you around! Maybe one day I will play Tibia again, but in the meantime job and university keeps me very busy =/ still I will try to be around the forums more frequently. 
 
I hope you are all fine!" />

Thanks Malmis, same with you. I miss lots of the old faces (I've already forgotten the name of most of them) but let´s hope they do appear time to time around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malmis</div><div class="date">03-13-2012, 17:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, rather few of them left... And unfortunently it can go days without any posts in the Proxy forums sometimes. :S I do what I can but it's really hard to keep the flame lit when really noone seems to be around. :p</div></div><hr />

I want to play on an OT but first need to know what has changed etc (yes I want an OT with the latest client)</div></div><hr />
