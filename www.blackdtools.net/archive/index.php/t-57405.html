The red code. Use it like it is to have whole seconds as delay, try only $randomnumber:1000&gt;30000$ and you get between 1000 and 30000 ms cooldown. 
 
Much better than having a high and random ticker for the events, they should react in 100-200ms not 250-500." />

Having high timer tick in Conditional Events is simulating lag, not a player.<br />
Using this is better, for example using $randomnumber:1100&gt;1250$ as event cooldown for casting healing spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I'm not sure if this is true but I thought every action preformed by BlackDProxy had a randomised &quot;wait&quot; time inbetween. At least in Cavebot and Runemaker you can change them. Can't check conditional window at the moment tho.<br />
<br />
If not I guess this is useful :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah BD is already random but I'd rather check the conds really often and react quicly then only use the cooldown for making it random.</div></div><hr />

And you Malmis are great teacher :D! Even tho I get lost almost instantly checking your scripts with all those '$&gt;=string&lt;fastexiva&gt;WHATEVER' I think I'll manaage to fully understand those, not just downloading them and using them. All scripts I ever used were 'hand written' by myself for personal use, but nothing worth comparing to yours lolz. Now I might consider of using someone else's scripts ... yours ofc. :P<br />
<br />
I just hope Daniel manages to fix up Cavebot, atm it just runs around as crazy beheaded chicken. &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
Great work, this one helped me a lot! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malmis</div><div class="date">03-03-2012, 03:03</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you. :)<br />
And I always try to make a bit tutorial-like posts with my thread-starts for scripts :P<br />
I'll see if I make some more real tutorials, anyways the Rookgaard tutorial if you look at the code the AutoRook bot hexes also work as comments and tells you what's going on so you can watch in-game what the code does and learn that way, might try to release a &quot;verbose&quot; version soon for learning, with more AutoRook chat. :P</div></div><hr />
