<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anonymous</div><div class="date">08-18-2015, 20:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Click the goo.gl link in the post above. This will update your bdp.<br />
If you are having trouble connecting to OTs, Follow these steps.<br />
1. Get fresh with BDP!, click the advanced button in bdp, and reload the config for a different version<br />
2. Make sure you set the version of the OT client when you re-open bdp.<br />
3. Check your path to the client you want to use.<br />
4. Ensure your automap is in the correct place. OT servers often have custom maps. If you use the default, all maps on the OT server will overwrite, and cause errors with your original automap. Unless you are playing on a server with a real map.<br />
5. Finally, make sure you have the proper OT server IP in place, as well as the login port (7171) by default for most servers unless otherwise noted.<br />
6. Start your game.<br />
<br />
I play on tibian a lot. Its an OT server with a real map, just boosted exp rates and free premium for everyone.<br />
Anyone that wants to play in a server with a custom client, will probably have to change the client name. For instance Tibians custom client, is Tibian.exe. Blackd will not find Tibian.exe in the folder i selected, because its not named Tibia.exe. Simply change the name, and that should be fixed.<br />
<br />
These are all the troubleshooting steps you should probably need.<br />
If you require any additional help, feel free to PM me with screenshots, and i will be as helpful as i can be :D Enjoi!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">08-19-2015, 09:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I have really few time nowadays. I only focus in keeping Blackd Proxy working in real servers. It still should work in some OT servers. However it will probably not work in servers where they changed something to confuse bots. Sometimes it have easy solution like you said (renaming the exe to Tibia.exe) However other times it requires complex changes in Blackd Proxy config and in worst case it have a different protocol/specially encrypted protocol and in such last cases you can just forget about using Blackd Proxy there. <br />
<br />
Note: If someone have very high interest in a special fix for his favourite OT server you can always donate me around 50 euros to my paypal daniel@blackdtools.com and then it will become my #1 priority to fix it for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alfredomt</div><div class="date">08-21-2015, 06:21</div></div><div class="posttext">I still can't connect in real Tibia, it's like BDP is 'blocking' my conection with the real server, I can't even connect to the my character list using BDP, OT is an example that i used to show that BDP is having trouble with tibia client I think, I need help :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">09-30-2015, 18:48</div></div><div class="posttext">in Tibia update days you should avoid using Blackd Proxy in real servers until I release a new version ready for it. It will not work AND it could be a risk for your account.<br />
<br />
Btw, I just released the update for Tibia 10.82.</div></div><hr />
