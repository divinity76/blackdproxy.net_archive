and i think this could work with tibia i havent tried it yet but i plan 2 soon any way i wanted to share my ideal <br />
with the software used to multibox in warcraft &lt;keyclone&gt; u can bradcast keys via multi windows or computers<br />
now i was thinking a 2box 1 knight 1 druid you could play the knight and use druid to heal without having to us its screen and if you used 1x new cliant and 1x old cliant you could set the new cliant so that you could move both at the same time let me tri to make all this bad typing little more clear now lol<br />
<br />
<br />
tibia 1 pc 1------ c++ client<br />
tibia 2 pc 2------ flash client<br />
<br />
keyclone  sends keys to both clients every time u hit a key<br />
<br />
you could change binds on client 2 to bind for movment on up,down,left,right and bind movment on client 1 for a,s,d,w thisway you could move both toons at the same time free of each other <br />
<br />
use this while using ingame spells to heal knight /attack target could make for seamless play while using shooters 2 hunt<br />
<br />
second option<br />
<br />
there is a second software called isboxer that also has a built in mouse broadcaster i was thinking i may use<br />
<br />
anyway i just wanted to share the ideal 2 see what every 1 else thinks <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;for a side note i want this to be 100% undetectable thats why i want to use 2pc this would work with multiclient on a single pc&gt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinnie</div><div class="date">07-13-2012, 21:15</div></div><div class="posttext">You could play the first character seeing as it's only a 'cond' unlike the second char which would use 'cavebot'<br />
<br />
But is that the sort of thing you was on about though!?</div></div><hr />
