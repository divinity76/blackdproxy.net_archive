i wanted to know if someone has the source code from tibia when it was leaked in 2005 and could share it with me to compare it to the source code from another project that i think might be the mother or origin of tibia. The Project was called Ultima 6 Online and its goal was it to port ultima 6 in to the internet that you could meet friends and play ultima 6 together. this project has very similar npcs to the ones from tibia and the map is stored in vga and map format where map" />

i wanted to know if someone has the source code from tibia when it was leaked in 2005 and could share it with me to compare it to the source code from another project that i think might be the mother or origin of tibia. The Project was called Ultima 6 Online and its goal was it to port ultima 6 in to the internet that you could meet friends and play ultima 6 together. this project has very similar npcs to the ones from tibia and the map is stored in vga and map format where map format is the format that the client from tibia stores the minimap in. also the items and monsters and chars look very similar. So what i am looking for is the souce code from tib and someone that wants to help me compare them ;) anyone able to help and interessted?<br />
<br />
Greetings Thorbenn</div></div><hr />

The game is very similar to the Ultima series in many aspects.<br />
<br />
From what i understand with chats from the gods years ago it was based on the ultima aspects but they made their own code</div></div><hr />
