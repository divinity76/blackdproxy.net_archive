1: Blackd as free, open source, largely comercial bot, won't work anymore(IMHO). But if Daniel make a new bot, I have a message for YOU ALL, he is 100% safe, I used Blackd for years, started maybe 7 years ago, with full customer support, safety and a nice community.

<br />
2: I did a macro for hunting a noob hunt, very noob, with a 400 command line, and I'm not a programmer, just like some informatics. This macro is 100% visual/mouse keyboard simulation(no memory/dll read/inject or W/E). If I can do, surely Daniel can do much better.<br />
<br />
3: Daniel/you was just a guy who sold me a software, but he took his time to gently answer in forum and emails, and I felt like he is a very nice guy, and I'm kinda thankfull for it.<br />

Nevermind anytihng below!<br />

I would be glad of paying the next Daniel's bot, even if it  costs $20-$30</div></div><hr />
