I hope you get it back at some point and can go through your things in real life</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">04-14-2012, 14:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously too bad ... There's more and more people joining/learning BlackD Proxy day by day and I'm afraid there will be no one to help them out with more advanced things. :(</div></div><hr />

You know, I always say it everywhere: the cavebot feature is not inteded for main chars because it is still detectable. I wish I knew what it is being detected exactly. Nobody knows yet.<br />
Cavebot is still good to farm gold with low level chars and it still can give you some advantage: Just transfer the obtained gold to your main char at the end of each day and you will minimize the loses in the banwaves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I don't get, because Ive been using Malmis's scripts since he came back and I got away scott-free. Not so much as a warning on any of my accounts. Maybe it was the experimenting with scripts that sent a bad packet maybe? I really don't know, but it's a real shame because Mamis is a Game Changer. Hope you;re back soon mate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-15-2012, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the problem is in some advanced commands that might be detectable at this moment.<br />
A person already reported me that the command that drop loot on depot might be one of the problems. ... It drops everything too fast and in periodic times so it might be detectable. I will try to add some time randomizers there and I will slow down it a bit.</div></div><hr />

If anyone think they can help please read http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?57980-Buying-Game-Code-with-Paypal (http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?57980-Buying-Game-Code-with-Paypal)<br />

Still alot going on IRL though but would be nice to be back to Tibia a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-09-2012, 00:15</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a hint: don't cavebot with main char for now. I made some improvements in the cavebot, but maybe it is not 100% safe yet.<br />
<br />
Btw, please read your pms.</div></div><hr />
