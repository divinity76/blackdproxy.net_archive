	<meta name="description" content="Hello Id like to start learning myself programming language, and how to actually program. Ive read abit about this and downloaded a compiler, c ++ 
Id like to know which programming language is the best for me as a beginner?  
 
How does people actually know what &quot;codes&quot; they should use? Is there like a lexikon or something where I can see all codes and their meaning? 
 
Cause It feels like I don't know anything, I went through some tutorials. And I understand abit of it but what I don't get," />
