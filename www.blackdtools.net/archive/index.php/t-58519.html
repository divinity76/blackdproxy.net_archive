So what webber meant is this.<br />
Say the rune you want to use on your char is an UH ,you go to the config file of the version folder you are playing,say 7.72 (-in the blackd install folder) after a bit of searching you'll find something like this tileID_UH=E1 08<br />
This means that you need to change the id to tileID_UH=80 0C then you will be able to use your exiva commands or cavebot autoheal to use UHs.<br />
<br />
Same thing goes for all other runes or objects,just look em up in the config file and change the id there to the id you see in game on your server.<br />
<br />
I hope you understand this somewhat messy explanation.</div></div><hr />
