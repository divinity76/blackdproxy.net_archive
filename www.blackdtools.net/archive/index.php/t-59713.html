Question: &quot;Do you recommend me any account seller?&quot;  
 
My answer: 
 
Sorry, I don't know about any seller who returns you the money if your account gets hacked. Sooner or later everybody gets hacked 9 of 10 times, for one reason or other. That is why I don't support any account seller. And I can't recommend you any.

Question: &quot;Do you recommend me any account seller?&quot; <br />
<br />
My answer:<br />
<br />
Sorry, I don't know about any seller who returns you the money if your account gets hacked. Sooner or later everybody gets hacked 9 of 10 times, for one reason or other. That is why I don't support any account seller. And I can't recommend you any.<br />
<br />
Some facts to keep in mind:<br />
- The original owner of the account can ALWAYS recover the account.<br />
- If you buy an account then you are NOT the original owner of that account.<br />
- 9 of 10 persons in Tibia are evil persons that will scam anyone whenever there is any chance to do it.<br />
- The account sellers usually resell the accounts of unknown original owners and they reject any responsability over the actions of the original owner.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the end you (almost) always lose:<br />
- money<br />
- account<br />
- time invested in that account<br />
- any item bought to chars of that account.<br />
<br />
Do you really want to take the big risk? It is up to you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Question: Then, What should I do?<br />
<br />
My answer:<br />
<br />
Make your own account from scratch, and buy gold to level it much faster. That is the only 100% safe method to get a high level account.</div></div><hr />

Why would anyone buy an account?</div></div><hr />

Most people do not have the time and skill to put towards 4-10 Months of a grind I guess? Personally I would never buy an acc because I have no problems making characters but It seems like much less of a goal to me, when I log into my RP and MS I get a shit grin every time &gt;;D Oh the memories.<br />
