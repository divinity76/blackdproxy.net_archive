In the BlackD Proxy folder, there is a folder called &quot;conds&quot; input these three .txt files into the folder, either re-start BlackD and or hit the (&lt;-Reload) button in the conditional screen. <br />
<br />
Voila, you now should be auto-healing and auto-drinking manas when low depending on what class you chose to load! These are also changeable right in the conditional menu screen by simply changing the number to your liking and hit &quot;Modify selected condition&quot;.<br />

Hope this helped anyone,<br />

I don't know maybe old habits die hard I like to physically see all the conditions are running before I set things up :) Thanks for the great tip, I definitely forgot! <br />
