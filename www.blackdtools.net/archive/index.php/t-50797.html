And I'm fairly sure he don't even have the sources left seeing as he don't even program in that lang anymore.<br />
<br />
So going the safest route for the program is out of the question.<br />
I guess if he saw this thread lill karamellz would get a small ego boost that people still talk about his program :)</div></div><hr />
