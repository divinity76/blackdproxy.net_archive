Yeah, they probarly won't find out. But it wouldn't be funny if they did. :p<br />
<br />
Only tried the Venore Orcs script (but removed the entire restocker and streamlined the script a little) but it works good. I'll see if the rest are as good when I have a use for them. :)</div></div><hr />

But that the scripts are old doesn't always matter, the Venore Rotworm script I released ages ago still works, waypoint-wise atleast. :)<br />
I'm not that scared of a ban since my main is played manually, I back him up with loads of bots. :)</div></div><hr />
