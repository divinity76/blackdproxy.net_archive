If you look at the script you are able to change the amount of gold to your liking when you want to go back for the deposit. In the next few days I will be releasing a few simple scripts for lower levels coming out of rook, In my hope to start the urge for other players to take the initiative to create their own scripts and maybe start this community back up. These scripts that will be released are of the poorest quality, not saying they will not work, they are scripts written when I first begun BlackD. Needless to say they will do the job, make sure you turn on your auto-eat function in Runemaker, load up the conditionals suited to your character once you are able to buy the spell &quot;light heal&quot; or &quot;wound cleansing&quot; for knights, and begin with a simple set good enough to whack some trolls! Again, I really hope this sparks a little interest in this community, my scripts now-a-days are a little more thought out and I hope to see everyone else helping out!<br />
<br />
Required; P-Set, Spikesword/Dwarven Shield few potions until you can get light healing/wound cleansing and some food for self sustain.<br />
<br />
Note: Start in middle of Thais depot in between banker/parcel vendor.<br />

<br />
Lithium' script should work since it includes all those monsters, buty if you're trying on your own then add this to your script:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
setMeleeKill bug<br />
setMeleeKill bat<br />
setMeleeKill cave rat<br />
<br />
<br />
And don't forget to put 'gotoScriptLine 0' at the end of the script like Lithium did.</div></div><hr />

Would you mind posting a script you're trying to use that doesn't work?</div></div><hr />
