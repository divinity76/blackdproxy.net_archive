Put a copy of the &quot;tibia.dat&quot; file from the custom Tibia client installation directory in your &quot;Blackd Proxy/config772&quot; (rename the old &quot;tibia.dat&quot; or delete it)<br />
Start Blackd Proxy and  open the &quot;Advanced&quot; window<br />
Select &quot;Tibia 7.72&quot; in the &quot;Load a config for different Tibia:&quot; drop-down and press &quot;Do it (will close ALL)&quot;<br />
Start Blackd Proxy and open the proxy window<br />
Set the forwarding option to &quot;Forward to OT server&quot;<br />
Enter &quot;tibianic-hr.org&quot; in server IP and &quot;7272&quot; in &quot;login port:&quot;<br />

Done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's 7.72, 7.41 and 7.4.<br />
<br />
Guys if you want a 7.4 bot; classic botter is a nice one.<br />
<br />
And if you want to use blackD on this; take the 7.72 modified clients tibia.dat, replace it with the other tibia.dat in config772.<br />
<br />
Then go onto 'advanced' on blackd, make it load for the 7.72 tibia client. Then press 'do it all~'<br />
<br />
Open blackd again, go on 'proxy', then go onto Forward to otservers, type in the box; tibianic-hr.org. In the port area, type in 7272. Close the blackd then.<br />
<br />
Open the tibia client of the modified 7.72 tibia client. Login to your character, log-out. Then close the loader. Open blackd proxy, press 'load for tibiaclient 7.72', then let everything load. Wait around 10 seconds, log on. If It says incorrect password/username. Then you have not waited long enough and should retry again shortly(this error is caused because blackd closed the server connection as it did not load everything perfectly yet). If it comes up with a red message on your screen saying something about 'blackd', everything has worked correctly.<br />
<br />
ALSO DO NOT RUN BLACKD OR TIBIA AS ADMINISTRATOR OR IT WILL NOT WORK!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was getting this error when I tried to play with 8.6<br />
<br />
its because u must change the config path to the client version<br />
<br />
go to blackd folder then open config.ini then change configPath=confignumber u want to use<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gogorabbi</div><div class="date">07-14-2012, 19:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive got an easyish question for one of you to anwser. im a bit slow when it comes to programs like these. infact today is the first time ive ever tried using any of blackd's programs. my question is, when changing tibianic's tibia.dat file and replacing it with the other tibia.dat in config772, where can i find the other tibia.dat that im trying to replace? I mean where do I find config 772?<br />
<br />
Ive tried following your guys intructions but, it seems blackdproxy will only open one client when i use the multiclient feature. The second time i try to use the mc feature it tells me that my tibia client is already running. anyone have any feedback? thanks inadvance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tony32</div><div class="date">12-05-2012, 22:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for necroposting, but I'm just wondering what needs to be done to be able to use the 7.72 client on this server at all? They seem to have updated their server so it says the client isin't allowed anymore. I guess it can be done by assembly editing, but what should I look for?<br />
<br />
EDIT: The client sends its version to the server and the server needs to verify it. Anyone know which client they are checking for on the server? The custom client they use is a modified 7.72 client, but as the modified it, the client probably pretends to be another version. The question is, which version? If anyone have info about this, please share.</div></div><hr />
