<br />
Daniel was going to make BlackD the best warbot ever, before the massbans happened. So I'm sure he has some of the programming already done.<br />
<br />
Note: This won't be for safe cheats as we won't know if its safe or not :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-01-2010, 16:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you be more specific? What kind of war functions, could you post examples of what you would like to see updated?<br />
Since i do not use them, i do not have a structured opinion about them :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">12-01-2010, 16:52</div></div><div class="posttext">Sio friend<br />
<br />
Combo SD (follow SD leader, not have to say/hear a message)<br />
<br />
Hold MW on a spot (so you'll auto spam it when it vanishes)<br />
<br />
Spam worm/gp under you (possible in conditions now but would be nice just to &quot;exiva spam&quot;)<br />
<br />
Would be nice to have auto haste/mana shield/heal paralize without having to open 3 seperate conditions too, click boxes in the warbot menu pls?</div></div><hr />

About the cavebot, some improvements were made and so far no one got banned for caveboting. However, it is still not advisable to use it on main character.<br />
<br />
@XHellsx<br />
<br />
I like your proposals and i think they are all pretty useful. However we need to think in a new &quot;spell name&quot; to put worms/gps under you, since the one you suggested is not the most intuitive xD<br />
<br />
I've added a new proposal to detect the number of monsters around you. For a long time Blackd needs this to cast area spells.<br />
Also added simple runemaking and food eater to Blackd Safe cheats</div></div><hr />

I will add it to the main thread :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">12-02-2010, 14:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the people left botting are the people who would script and make complecated conditions have all left. Only left are the lazy people - Thats why we need all of the conditional events we use on a daily basis to be simple tick boxes for noobs.<br />
<br />
Should attract new customers (therefore motivating Daniel to continue the business)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tony32</div><div class="date">12-02-2010, 15:39</div></div><div class="posttext">re-enable autorelog and magebomb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadow1</div><div class="date">12-02-2010, 16:06</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yea magebomb would be amazing, atleast for ots.. itd be a nice functio</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-02-2010, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, magebomb stills available if you connect to versions before 8.40, i guess.<br />
A new relog option would be also a good idea, specially for those who want to farm 24/7. I know the last packet made does not match with the Tibia's new one, but what about a whole new function that could relog you if the system clock says X hour?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">12-02-2010, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">re-enable autorelog and magebomb.<br />
 <br />
Still waiting for this, got my magebomb ready STILL!<br />
<br />
And I'm currently red skull trapping and a magebomb would be much easier than relying on my friends logging in noob characters :/<br />
<br />
EDIT: THIS IS ALL ON REAL TIBIA NOT OTS</div></div><hr />

Samzo, could you tell us more about what kind of functions you would like to see updated for war?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 6873<br />
Hope you mean this?:) I did it for you my dear.<br />
<br />
It is opensource and programmed in vb.net and the bin files are in bin/debug folder. Enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
Merry Christmas!<br />
<br />
P.S I did it as fast as I could, but is seams to work great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">12-08-2010, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">its vb.net, blackd uses vb6</div></div><hr />

 <br />
For now I made a new free tool for autoeating food.</div></div><hr />

It worth the affords :D</div></div><hr />

 I think BlackD disabled it since 8.42 or something? I aint sure. But I'd love to see it working again.. It's just so much fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">02-09-2012, 19:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys!!!<br />
Remember this thread? I know its a kinda old but since it has some good ideas, I decided to bump it so our new programmer can check it. <br />
Hans, as you can see, many of us have been requesting small features over time, options that can make BlackD more useful. Could you add some of those features? :)<br />
Please!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
@Mods:<br />
If you think I should not bump such a old thread, please close it and I'll open a new one. One that does not mention Christmas :p. If you don't really care, your saving me from a hardish copy/paste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">killemal</div><div class="date">02-10-2012, 18:17</div></div><div class="posttext">I propose that safe cheats gets a &quot;magic hotkey&quot; it would work like so:<br />
<br />
This cheat would detect when a hotkey is down e.g &quot;F1&quot; and then detect what the players currently targetted monster is. If the creature matches a user defined list the bot will then send a different hotkey to the client e.g F2.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would mean that if I made a list like so:<br />
Demon skeleton,exori san<br />
Hydra,exori con<br />
plague smith,exori san<br />
<br />
Then by pressing f1 the bot would detect what my current targets name is and perform the spell I choose.<br />
<br />
Also if you wanted to take it further you could fix another annoying thing , for e.g plague smiths run to fast and exori san only has a 5sqm range , so if you also added a a max distance varible so I could do somehting like so:<br />
<br />
Plague smith,exori san,3<br />
Plague smith,exori san,12<br />
<br />
I think that would be awsome especially for sorcs.</div></div><hr />
