<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">09-12-2011, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">If you set your magebomb up right and remember to disable anti ban mode in configs and set blackd to the correct client then it should be working...<br />
<br />
Make sure the IDs of SD is correct for the OT your playing.<br />
<br />
But then again new blackdproxy has so much fucked up settings that it might even be broken using it on older clients :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">siimsi</div><div class="date">09-13-2011, 03:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I do set the right id in the config, about the anti ban mod in config, i cannot find it!<br />
<br />
Edit: Found it, still not working. I putted the correct ids in the config aswell &amp; changed to the right client - Still not working.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: Just tried it out on a another client (not hotkey system - 7.8+) and it did work to shot without any bp open..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">09-13-2011, 18:13</div></div><div class="posttext">What version you trying to use it on? I believe it only works once hotkeys were implemented into the game?<br />
<br />
OThere might be a setting in BlackD magebomb which says use battle list or something else? try changing that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">siimsi</div><div class="date">09-13-2011, 23:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Well like i said, back in old days when 7.6-7-7 was the real client (rl tibia),<br />
it was possible to use mage bomb. Gonna report back here later when I've tried a few things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">siimsi</div><div class="date">09-16-2011, 04:36</div></div><div class="posttext">So Ive bacisly tried all things I could get in my mind, still not working. So I guess it only worked with the old black versions, (not tibia version).<br />
is there a way to get old blackd versions?</div></div><hr />
