Or would that be too painful to &quot;convert&quot; it (or even impossible), just to release a free software ? I knoooow it sounds retarded what I said, because I really suck at programming, so I don't know the proper words to express better what I'm thinking, but I think you got my point.<br />
 If not, do you plan to create another paid bot, one that doesn't get caught as much as blackD ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can't be converted. Everything in Blackd Proxy depends on the proxy core. My bot gets all the game information from received packets at proxy, and it performs all actions by sending packets through that proxy connection. This does not work while Cipsoft is rejecting connections that goes through proxies.<br />
I would have to write a new bot from scratch, but I don't have time for it. Maybe I will release some new minor safe cheat tools, but nothing else.</div></div><hr />

If someone stumbles upon this information feel free to share it here.</div></div><hr />

Enough work for today. Tomorrow I will deal with the new character list system. After that step Blackd Proxy will have full control of the game connection again, so everything will probably work again.</div></div><hr />

mmm, no, sorry. I mean that features that worked in 10.1 will work in 10.11.<br />
Magebomb is not possible since long time ago and won't be possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niniots</div><div class="date">08-27-2013, 00:16</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm using BlackD Proxy for the last year on OTs mostly though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've just noticed that Trainer doesn't work properly on BlackD Proxy version 29.4 for Tibia client 10.10<br />
<br />
I'm using it mostly to clean up depots/trash/etc. However, on version 29.4 it'll pick up individual items set in Trainer, but it won't pick them, if I set '00 00' (which is used to pick 'any' item).<br />
<br />
Other than that, it works great. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beggari</div><div class="date">08-28-2013, 01:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the effort you've putted into it, blackd. You're the man.<br />
<br />
edit: btw, I know it's not the support part, but lemme ask here; well, some of my chars doesn't get recognized by blackdproxy. It's like, some of them works properly, just like before; but on some others blackd doesn't recognize them - I still get the blackd message when logging in, but when I go to the cavebot, the client char line is blank, it's like it's connected but has no name, while other accounts logged in have their name there, and clients that are not opened still shows correctly 4 - not connected, 5 - not connected, and so on. But some logged chars are totally blank. I tried deleting the .txt autoload of the characters that weren't working, reopening blackd but still didn't work. The funny thing is other characters of the same account blackd still recognize!<br />
 I just thought I should warn you about that =d<br />
                                                                                                                                                       Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
if you are still experiencing that problem in 29.7 then just send me an email reporting me it again there.</div></div><hr />
