A software that costs 20+ bucks, i'm sure you can figure out the one i mean.<br />
<br />
Even if the bot were detected like i imagine the detection system works, i think i would escape due to the way iv'e got the bot setup, only one thing i can't change that might get me banned. (Except if tibia setups a malaware scanner in their client..<br />
<br />
Of course there's a few other ways i imagine i can get caught but obviously won't mention this since i guess cip might have someone checking these boards, who knows eh</div></div><hr />

I can tell you 2 things, and i'm quite certain this is a way to flag your account<br />
I never visit tibia after i've visited any botting related sites.. <br />
<br />
That could flag your ip, to lazy to explain why but simply visit a neutral site and you'll avoid that.<br />
<br />
The second is never to talk about the bot ingame, or atleast never admit you use it,. don't even hint to someone that you use it, always deny..<br />
<br />
<br />
Those 2 i can share, since I'm doing that already :)<br />
And it's so easy for them to do, and i see no reason why they don't do it, they already have all the stats needed to do it, and people knowledgeable about the stuff obviously. So the referer thing I'm 95% sure they already do.</div></div><hr />

We could speculate, but no1 really knows i guess.<br />
Makes sense the premium accounts start with a lower risk of getting deleted on the first offence, they want to keep their paying players.</div></div><hr />

Honestly that sounds like crap. I mean, cipsoft have to have some proper indication that you are botting, I don't bot but I check this forum often, and somtimes I talk with people in tibia about botting. Also, only something technical can explain why you are much more likely to get banned if you use certain bots than others.</div></div><hr />
