wow thanks you helped me alot :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">05-31-2010, 16:51</div></div><div class="posttext">do you think wesker have a vpn to all clients to connect to?<br />
<br />
If so I reinstall a computer to get it 100% clear and make a proxy.<br />
<br />
Should be kinda easy<br />
<br />
But blackd and some other great programmer claims that the detecion ISNOT clientsided, and this should only remove that possibility</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friday</div><div class="date">05-31-2010, 17:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i wonder how it could be safe because its just the ip or isnt it? I have the premium now for free 12 months and i will work on it to find out how it works.<br />
<br />
ps: if cipsoft dont know my ip so they cant scan or w/e my computer?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I talked with the Creator of VPN and he said it couldnt help because its my Computer which sends packets to Tibia included the Bot-Modification.. <br />
<br />
Cipsoft is not scanning any Computer, its your computer which gives the informations to CipSoft and thats the thing.. As Daniel said &quot;i try to send safe packets&quot; but how this guy made it work then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pater</div><div class="date">05-31-2010, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">detection is server side. And VPN is not a way to avoid banishment. What we need is only take care of sending packet - not only good method to send it but also its format. Thats all. If u think it is client side it is easy to check just inject simple code which modify client but doesn't send any packet and you will see that u won't get bannes</div></div><hr />

The  only thing with a vpn is you computer information that cipsoft wont scan either way.<br />
<br />
And btw there is a realy good thread on tugforums where Jo3 explain so even a realy noob can understand. I realy want to point that Im not flaming anyone exept wesker if hes &quot;tutorial&quot; recomend you to use a vpn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im still sticking to my theory that they ban you by repetitive paths, but im going to buy this to see what its about<br />
<br />
can anyone confirm its vpn?</div></div><hr />

Its not VPN, that program just gives you massive laggs and safes your computer against IP scan but has nothing to do with tibia because tibia will still send packets positive if using bot.<br />
<br />
If you want to try VPN i can give you a code which gives you 12 months premium. Datasafe avaible.<br />
<br />
ps: vpn is great if you download movies and shit but really nothing else :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

&quot;As redes virtuais privadas baseiam-se na tecnologia de tunelamento cuja existência é anterior às VPNs. Ele pode ser definido como processo de encapsular um protocolo dentro de outro. O uso do tunelamento nas VPNs incorpora um novo componente a esta técnica: antes de encapsular o pacote que será transportado, este é criptografado de forma a ficar ilegível caso seja interceptado durante o seu transporte. O pacote criptografado e encapsulado viaja através da Internet até alcançar seu destino onde é desencapsulado e decriptografado, retornando ao seu formato original. Uma característica importante é que pacotes de um determinado protocolo podem ser encapsulados em pacotes de protocolos diferentes. Por exemplo, pacotes de protocolo IPX podem ser encapsulados e transportados dentro de pacotes TCP/IP.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
seems to me, very noobly, that vpn is useless,, even if the detection were clientside, since the communication between the vpn server and the tibia server is the usual, <br />
<br />
PS: does the forum guy offer a free safe vpn server to the buyers?<br />
<br />
can anyone explain me what means the detection being not clientside, but server side? and why was it stated that it is server sided?<br />
<br />
@klusbert<br />
i havent found anything on internet about &quot;tugforums / Jo3 &quot;, can you lead me to a link?</div></div><hr />

<br />
His guide is to hide info about your programs.<br />
Wich fails because I made a homemade bot, with the name &quot;lada&quot; And I don't think cipsoft have any clue that it was a cheat program for tibia.<br />

Busted!!</div></div><hr />
