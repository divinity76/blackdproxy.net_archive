<br />
Many of you know me already from previous scripts but for those who don't let me tell you a little about me. I am bored of playing Tibia manually or botting so I've decided I will make scripts upon request. <br />
For all those who are wondering, I am studying Computer Science and I find programming (even Blackd Cavebot) fun!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately my botting characters are quite low levels at the moment and thus I cannot create scripts for hard areas. At the moment I am considering doing scripts for both PACC and FACC areas. (Take a look at my botting characters so you can judge whether I will be able to make your script or not). I can do depositors, refillers, sellers, etc. with options like open doors, etc. I could also do training scripts, conditionals, and I will most certainly try to do any other scripts that you think of. You can also ask me to update an old script to fit the newest client and make it safe.<br />
<br />
PM or post a reply, but please do not send me messages like &quot;script for knight please&quot;. I need to know the place to hunt and what you want/need. <br />
<br />
Since I am not selling the scripts the only thing you have to agree is that I will release the script to the public. The only way you could prevent me from doing this is if you convince me it&#8217;s a secret place: I'll respect that. But it really has to be a secret place not just 'hidden larva cave' or 'darashia rots'.<br />
<br />
If you want to see what my scripts looking like and rate them yourself, check the links in my signature.<br />
Hopefully I can make your script: I am looking forward to doing so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chains</div><div class="date">02-16-2011, 07:42</div></div><div class="posttext">hello mate, I tried to use your script for the tarantulas task yesterday and it didn't quite work for me, it just said not possible and the character got stuck, so I dont know if it needs an update or something I'm doing the task on a knight, and also I know its not possible for your character yet, but I'd love a script for the hydras task, on a 118 MS hopefully your mage will be ready to do that soon enough.<br />
<br />
Also I want to raise a paladin, so a paladin version of the rook script would be great, i read it only works for knights, so lvl 11 on a paladin would be lovely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">02-16-2011, 08:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello chains, I am glad you are interested in my scripts.<br />
I will add your requests to my scripting list, my only question would be if you want the rook script for a PACC or FACC.<br />
I will added them in this order Rook Script, Tarantula Task, Hydra Task (Some Day).<br />
<br />
I am thinking of just doing PACC scripts but that will depend on how safe BlackdProxy seems to be in the next couple months.<br />
My project of automated 1-11(or higher) seems to useless for FACCs so I will be doing later for PACCS only. For now I will be doing a script that takes your character from Rook to Main with the desired vocation. (Both for FACC and PACC).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chains</div><div class="date">02-16-2011, 12:39</div></div><div class="posttext">PACC is perfect, msg me as soon as you have it cause id love to try it..  pm with your email so i may add you on msn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">02-16-2011, 21:06</div></div><div class="posttext">It might take a bit longer since I want to make sure that there is no room for banishment caused by my script. Every time I assumed an item was somewhere, now I am going to have to check that it is actually there so it doesn't send a packet saying something invalid.<br />
<br />
For example, my old scripts if I assumed that there was an axe on the left hand, I would automatically send a hex to  move axe to bag from left hand. However, there is a big theory that says that sending invalid packets results in banishment and thus I will validate to really check that the axe is there. That should make things safer from the scripts perspective.<br />
<br />
This is not only regarding your scripts but everyone's.<br />
<br />
For my MSN, take a look at my profile.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chains</div><div class="date">02-24-2011, 05:20</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty good tarantula script. I know i'm asking for too much, but whenever you get the level on a paladin, I would love a noob paladin script, following all the way up on formorgar glacier, only on noob monsters, for low level paladins using spears, theres lots of polar bears, penguins, winter wolves and stuff, picking up spears from frost trolls and using them on the hand so it never runs out of spears, maybe a non reset floor spot where it drops them whenever it has over 15 so it wont affect capacity, and going there to pick some more when it only has 3 in the hand, maybe with conditions you could do it so it may go and hunt frost giants and stronger monsters there, but only if I choose it to, its a lot I know but I also know youre able to do so. thanks bro.<br />
<br />
P.S. my paladin is only lvl 10 so I see you dont have any paladins, I could lend mine to you, it already has pacc so i would trust the account to you without problem, pm me if you would like the paladin for your scripts for free it would only cost you some levels as you script on it lol</div></div><hr />

After translating this post on google translator, I was happy and I congratulate you for the initiative, even if you like me, not having high-level accounts.<br />
Well, I would like a Script:<br />
Knight and Paladin FACC<br />
Level 20-40<br />
Place of Hunt:<br />
Dwarf and Dwarf Soldier near Kazordonn<br />
<br />
That sells the Batle Axe, Shield Dwarf, in Kazordonn, buy mana and health potion and save the Crossbow in DP, so I sell in the future fibula.<br />
<br />
Make the bot leave the cav and return to the City, when you have low mana, potion, or even with a full cap, so far failed to make the bot use more than one bag, which he fills the main event, not open the to store other items.<br />
<br />
PS: If you do to me, only part of the sale and purchase of items, since I'm happy.<br />
<br />
I look forward to, thanks</div></div><hr />

Could you maybe create a hunt place for a level 30 paladin. FACC.<br />

I need a refiller and depositer to it. So basiclly, hunt, sell the things, refill pots and spears and then go hunt again.<br />

The location doesn't really matter, just some good place.. cyclops at POH should be good, or if you know any other place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to make a request for mutated humans/rats at yalahar. (got a script now but it isnt verry good.. since it doesnt go up the ramp so it doesnt kill anny rats and if i have bad luck stucks at tower so it doesnt move for 15 in..)<br />
I want it to go up the ramps and down the holes and loot the flesh and money, Spellbook of Enlightenment , tower shield, and stealth ring. can u also add depositer and refiller so it buys 100 strong health pots and buy new at 15 left?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
