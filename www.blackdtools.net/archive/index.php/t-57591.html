Players Online<br />
<br />
Overall Maximum:   64028 players (on Nov 28 2007, 19:26:00 CET)<br />
<br />
pretty much says it all botting wasnt even a huge thing then either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-27-2012, 17:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed it at the sales. Less players = less sales of tibia gold :(<br />
I don't really know the reason.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is because tibia servers are very unstable and people are probably waiting for the new anti-lagdeath feature that will come in the next patch:<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the already existing precautionary measure of a mass kick which is triggered if the connections to a certain amount of players are lost at the same time, the spring patch will add several new mechanisms to alleviate the negative effects of lag and kicks for players.<br />
<br />
If the server identifies that your connection is gone, the time it takes until your character is logged out will then depend on your vocation because each of them has different chances of survival. Druids and sorcerers will be kicked out of the game after 40 seconds, paladins after 50 seconds, knights and characters without a vocation after 60 seconds.<br />
Also, if the server identifies a connection loss, your character will be ignored by monsters for 30 seconds. If your connection gets restored during this time, monsters will attack you again immediately. If you cannot reestablish your connection and your character is logged out so that you have to log in again, a new login mechanism will help to give your character a certain chance to survive such a complete kick.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope a lot of players will return to the game if this feature really save lifes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since CIP got rid of hotkey abusing to stay online, I started using a macro tool to prevent kick by dancing. I make ~20 hours a day, the gap between me and the old hotkey abusers gets bigger and bigger.<br />
<br />
How safe is this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-27-2012, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I guess the hotkey thing is part of the problem.<br />
I guess it also killed many players who loved to train legally sticking a key in the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Don't worry. I just uploaded a new version of Blackd Proxy. It fixes and improves the autodance feature of the Trainer. The dance is absolutely random in time and movement so it should not be detectable.<br />
The cavebot is still detectable, but you should be safe if you don't use that feature of Blackd Proxy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jantje</div><div class="date">03-27-2012, 20:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your fast response Daniel!<br />
I'd rather use your bot with randomized dance feature than my macro. Somehow I doubt that CIP will instantly delete players for AFK training this way.</div></div><hr />

In real tibia there are 8000 players online,</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are 100% afk all the time and I found them (with same bp settup/eq/etc) on every server I played.<br />
<br />
Thats like 70*15 characters = 1050 which is like 5-10% of online players gone xD</div></div><hr />

This would definitely solve a good portion of pally training issues ;p very annoying having to refill spears. But yes, as of late it looks like no one scripts anymore either! What a shame and such a good tool keep up the great work Daniel.</div></div><hr />

Please send me an email with details about this problem, examples, and your exact proposal for the solution.<br />
It would also help me if you tell me how to test this thing with a level 8 char with a lot of spears.<br />
If it is not very hard then I guess I can fix it.</div></div><hr />

yes, if I were Cipsoft I would start some servers with older versions -or at least with older pvp rules. They could easily multiply players x2 or x3 that way.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry. When I released the free version I already removed all the code that connected to my server for auth. So my program does not need to connect to any web now. It would keep working even if blackdtools.net does not work.<br />
<br />
At this moment Blackd Proxy only needs a connection with Tibia and your Tibia server. Nothing else.<br />
Of course it contains a link to my tibia gold shop page, but it does not connect you there unless you click in the &quot;Buy Gold&quot; button (or in the advertisement at installation)</div></div><hr />

The tibianic servers (he has both a lowrate and a highrate server) is quite well populated,i mean back in the day when 7.4 / 7.5 was out on RL tibia there was about 800 online on antica at peak,which is the same as tibianic has ATM..<br />
Me myself and alot of ppl i know play the HR server and all i can say is that its very nice!</div></div><hr />

Played lots of high level characters (200-350~), done everything from hunting to fighting some really sick wars (Titania, about 3k frags in 1½ month).<br />
And I must say that I find it way more exciting and fun to kill level 10's on Tibianic (7.4).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I got some doubts, remember there was the similar server to tibianic around like 2 years ago? Something like 'classic tibia' I dunno, they had to shut down the OT server cuz CipSoft 'stepped on their tails' cuz they were gaining so much players and CipSoft decided to take legal actions, don't ask me which ones, I just barely remember what happened. It was a big story among OT players tho.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you can help me with two problems i'm having using blackd when playing OT.<br />
1.How to bypass the soulpoint system in the runemaker,since the ot im playing doesn't use soulpoints and they are always at 0 the runemaker wont make any runes..<br />
<br />
2.The auto eat food option doesnt work since the itemid doesnt match,however i dont understand where to change the id since in the config all i find is this and i dont understand what to change here..<br />
;FOOD<br />
tileID_firstFoodTileID=F9 0D<br />
tileID_lastFoodTileID=17 0E<br />
tileID_firstMushroomTileID=8B 0E<br />
tileID_lastMushroomTileID=8F 0E<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

you could start fixing some important functions that doesnt work in ot<br />
