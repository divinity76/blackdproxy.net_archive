http://blackdtools.net/myimages/initial_config.jpg<br />
For most people, the recommended settings should be correct, so just press the button CONTINUE (5) and forget about the rest.<br />
<br />
However, if you are curious about all the options, below is the meaning of each of them:<br />
<br />
(1) Select your Tibia version. If you are running real Tibia, then we recommend you to choose Tibia 10.99 OFFICIAL TIBIA (that is what Cipsoft now calls &quot;Tibia 10&quot;) This old client is better, so use it while Cipsoft still allow it. If Cipsoft it removed Tibia 10 by the time you read this tutorial then just use Tibia 11 client and choose latest &quot;official tibia&quot; Tibia 11 config in this dropbox.<br />
<br />
(2) Your Tibia client path here. Press this button to search your Tiia client path in case your Tibia client is not installed in the default folder! If you don't know where your Tibia client is installed then reinstall it again and this time open your eyes while you install it. It should ask you to define the path in one of the installation steps. When you press Next button then you are accepting the proposal they give you. In the case of the old &quot;Tibia 10&quot; client this path is USUALLY (not always) C:\Program Files (x86)\Tibia\<br />
<br />
(3) Your Tibia minimaps path here. Minimaps are always in the same place so you don't need to worry about this part, unless you want the cavebot to load a different set of maps (for example a pack of fully explored maps) In this last case just press the button define the folder of your custom maps.<br />
<br />
(4) Check this box to display this initial config screen again in next run. You might be interested in this option in case you are not sure about your current config setting. Anyways you can always reach this screen again if you go to old Menu&gt;Advanced&gt;&quot;Reset to select different Tibia Version&quot;<br />
<br />
(5) Press this button when you everything is ready. Then the bot should start loading everything and finally it will display the main menu.<br />
<br />
(6) (RARE CASES) If bot failed to load the list of Tibia versions then you can try reloading it from harddisk by using this button.<br />
<br />
(7) (VERY RARE CASES) If bot is unable to load the list from hard disk then you can try reloading it from the values displayed in the textbox.</div></div><hr />
