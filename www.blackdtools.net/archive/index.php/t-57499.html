<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balox</div><div class="date">03-14-2012, 01:45</div></div><div class="posttext">To bot i would use the Knight but it's also possible to bot the Paladin easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malmis</div><div class="date">03-14-2012, 02:14</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have a spear-refill you can bot most anything that EKs can bot on a paladin. In my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vacti</div><div class="date">03-14-2012, 11:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think that a knight is the best char for botting but also think that a paladin is funnier to play for its nice damage and also nice def.<br />
<br />
Also, as Malmis said the only thing I've to implement on scripts is a spear refill (I will try to learn to do them)...<br />
<br />
I still a bit confused ^^'<br />
<br />
Which vocation is better to bot on pacc zone? Any suggeriments of how to bot both? Is it necessary to skill if i'm going to bot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malmis</div><div class="date">03-14-2012, 16:25</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't have to skill, just as usual. But as usual it effects performance. :p<br />
The difference is the bot doesn't mind killing the same mobs all the time so hunting low-level mobs for a long time works with crap skills, but it's not effective. But as you might get killed or deleted the time spent training is wasted.<br />
<br />
I would train my &quot;main&quot; and only do the other characters if they have to, if the profit is too low or you get sick of seeing the same char that took level 12 take 60 in the same rot cave...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you can add the refiller yourself there's very few scripts with one, yeah.<br />

I agree, mages rocks with refillers... But mages or so weak and the Bot can't run, so atleast I am having a hard time what to do with 50ish my ED. :p</div></div><hr />

I will have to wait to war guilds ^^'</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's a big problem, but mages are great to bot when you're at least around your PC :D Bot water elementals and you will fall in love with them</div></div><hr />
