Things you should know before reading farther.<br />
<br />
Pskonejott<br />
Pskonejott.com is a site that records online time of all tibia players. If you have too high times, you're on the top of the list which is often browsed by anti-botters. Being online more than 20 hours in single day leaves a permanent record at your site's profile. Players find that site very helpful in determining whether you bot or not. GMs must not take this site as a credible proof BUT they always check there if you're reported and find botters/sharers that don't get reported through that site. Site measures time between 12.00 CETs<br />
Reports<br />
Players can report you through ctrl+r AND gm forum. Getting reported on gm forum is by far more dangerous, gms of different worlds check it frequently and they can even visit you some hours after report was made. Ctrl+r is dangerous only on worlds with Gms playing on. It's  important to figure out how often do you see GMs spamming trade so you know if ctrl+r causes any threat to you. Inexperienced players (a.k.a noobs:D) know only ctrl+r, but if tutor sees you botting, he'll most probably report you on gm forum.<br />
<br />
Stamina<br />
A curse casted by CIP on every botted. Once you get rid of  your first 56H it turns out that you can be online around 8h per day to keep it on stable level.  Always bot in the optimal 8 hours for you. Stamina is the only thing that keeps you from botting effectively, it&#8217;s important to know its value, so you can earn exp botting at the same rate as powergamers that keep their stamina low hunting manually.<br />
	<br />
Forum threads<br />
If some active in the community player sees you botting, there is a chance he'll make a thread on your game world. That may be a very troublesome situation, especially on pvp worlds. Players that read the thread will surely viplist you. In pvp worlds it means you're hunted, in nonpvp it means you're gonna earn few more pot trappers and report bumpers.<br />
<br />
Alarms<br />
There are 3 types of alarms you can turn on in blackd (except advanced, custom alerts in conditional events). That's ding on msg, bleep on pk on screen and danger alarm in Runemaker. Use them wisely. <br />
<br />
Something about server types<br />
<br />
pvp-enforced<br />
Botting at pvp-enforced wouldn't be your best idea. Any kill stealing or ignoring hi/leave msg mean    pvp fight. Keep your ding on msg alarm on to make sure you answer any time someone talks to you. Keep your bleep on player on screen alarm so you're ready for incoming attack:D. I don't even have to mention you should stay near pc, do I? Getting &quot;hiscore&quot; at pskonejott can make ppl pay you a visit, and then even if you respond, they might not want the travel time go to waste and attack anyways. :D Stay below the radar all the time. Once you get noticed, they'll all hunt you down.<br />
<br />
Normal pvp<br />
Keep a basic auto-responder when you're away from pc. Players will think twice before attacking you then. Maybe you are not afk but just don't feel like talking? It can't help you with gms though. Try not to get a forum thread about you cheating. It may ruin a char. If you're low lvl and don't mind a death now and then you can bot away from pc away from crowded places. Make a OnDangerGoTo Dp in your script, it can save your ass if pk is noob and can't trap. Always keep some uhs on you, people sometimes attack pk with their noobchars to save unjusts on main, which makes it possible to escape with some uhs. Normal pvp worlds aren't that bad but still hard to bot really hardcore on them without consequences.<br />
<br />
Nonpvp<br />
Here your only enemies are trappers and GMs. Get yourself a pot mashing script, on trap alarm if you're near pc. A basic responder wouldn't hurt although it isn't so effective as on pvp worlds &#8211; no one can attack you anyways. Be careful with getting too many enemies though - they might turn out annoying after all. People can't harm you but they can bump reports of you at gm forum. Blacklists usually don&#8217;t do much harm, ppl don&#8217;t give a shit about it. Just be careful with most influential guild&#8217;s blacklists if you&#8217;ll need quest cleaners later.<br />
<br />
I assume you read the tips for every type of game world, I won't repeat them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Colorion</div><div class="date">11-11-2007, 00:00</div></div><div class="posttext">HOW TO BOT?<br />
<br />
Botting at night (bed near pc)<br />
Keep pk alarm on, you'll wake up and have enough time to react properly (or at least buy bp rope and shovel and go back to spawn:D). Before getting to sleep check once again all the settings of bot - especially runemaker, conds and healing. Do an exiva testsound to be sure alarm is loud enough. It is loud enough when it makes your blood pressure rise so you get less sleepy than before testsound. <br />
Every time you're woken up by alarm and go to sleep again, do an exiva testsound. It is very important, believe me. You're woken up, half-conscious and probably the first thing you'll do is to turn the volume down:D. Sooner you learn to do exiva testsound the better for you. It&#8217;s a comfortable thing to set a hotkey for exiva cancel. This will make you unlearn the so unhealthy habit of turning the volume down as you can quickly turn off alarm in better way.<br />
<br />
Not getting noticed by Pskonejott<br />
If you're botting on a char you care about, NEVER get a 20+h &quot;insomniac&quot; record. Check the &quot;hiscores&quot; OF online time per week on your world. Make sure you don't get in the first ten. If you follow those two rules, you should be safe.<br />
<br />
Outfit<br />
Dont make extremely stupid outfit (all pink:P) and don't leave the one you received on rook. Don't pick nobleman, he's gay:P Often change your outfits, anytime you change, pick different colours and type. It's all to keep attention away from you, people will find it harder to remember you if your outfit keeps swapping and they're more likely to believe you bot if you pick a stupid outfit.<br />
<br />
Name<br />
Certain names just draw attention, which is what you do not want. Dont make too short like Akoe or too complicated (Kunegurtiksolinditta). Don't make stupid ones like  Goosegutter. I think the best name would be with two short parts or one longer and meaningless like Arthos Meak or Haminaton.<br />
<br />
Waypoints<br />
Always set your waypoints behind the spawn, not before. Bot will kill the monsters and go back to waypoint which will make player nearby realize at once that you're botting.<br />
<br />
Spawns<br />
Don't bot on public spawns on pvp world. It requires much less interaction to go into private one and leave a letter. Some comfortable botting spots are:<br />
ank scarabs - they're not very often occupied in the age of tortoises :P Not too many people go there. Middle and hidden are two most popular, rest should 95% time empty. Pretty safe<br />
port hope north - as long as you keep Friendly or Veryfriendly in cavebot, people would have to follow you quite long to determine you're botting. Open areas are nice and this one is nicely close to depo aswell<br />
hellgate - no bot hunter would bother taking such trip just to check for botters. Ofc not too many people inside. Also perfect spot for training on mc, bugs below elf spawn<br />
fibula - I didn't have an occasion to check this one myself, but there are no longer ds spawns and it could be a great facc rot spawn if you have a house there and set depositer.<br />
<br />
Some places you shouldn't bot at:<br />
Larva caves - 1  sqm paths surely don't serve well avoiding traps and running from Pks. Very hard to find those caves empty<br />
Darashia rots - that's right, caves seem nice but it's a favourite place of antibotters on both pvp and nonpvp worlds. Btw you can be lured and pushed to scorpion there so set atk on it :P<br />
Venore swamp trolls - fire covered in trash is your doom. If you can't heal yourself from fire don't bot there afk. Lots of people always there, lots of noob Pk<br />
Tortoises on high poulated worlds - people tend to get annoyed if you bot there next to them :P remember that throwing trash at shovel spot can trap you really easily. Maybe set some gp moving hex before every shovel spot?<br />
These are just basic examples to show you the criteria of judging if spawn is nice for bot or isn't. By no means I meant to spoil your favourite places :P<br />
<br />
HOW TO AVOID BANS<br />
<br />
Take an hour and study the damn tibia rules. Know what you can and can't do. This knowledge may sometimes really save your ass.<br />
<br />
Gm visits<br />
If gm decides to visit you, he will ask a few questions that auto-responder can't take. They seem to really enjoy questions like 8+3=? . Think about including every possibility of such &quot;questions&quot; into your auto responder if you really want to handle gms afk. They also often ask like &quot;how is your day today&quot; or &quot;how&#8217;s it going&quot; &quot;having a nice hunt?&quot; and thousand different variations of &quot;sup&quot;.<br />
<br />
 GMs just KNOW that you bot, they usually believe reports, they see Pskonejott, they know what are hunting spots for botters. Don't think you fooled them by responding fast, only thing saving you from ban lack of proof. You're guilty from the moment he teleports<br />
<br />
What should be your attitude?<br />
Don't be cynical, don't joke around, don't be smartass thinking that he can't do shit cause you respond. I know it's fun for you to do but it will make you remembered and it will make GM more determined to catch you afk next time. Be polite, cooperative, answer shortly. Be nice but don't be an ass licker. If you did study tibia rules like I told you, you&#8217;ll notice that making gm&#8217;s investigation harder can result in ban itself. A funny story once happened to me. Gm spawned next to me and &#8230;<br />
GM  4+2=?<br />
ME 5<br />
ME Fuck, brb calc<br />
ME 6<br />
GM I could ban you for getting it wrong first time<br />
This dialogue got into Tibia.br front page news soon after :P even though Im pl. That&#8217;s right, he could ban me. Keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
What is proof enough? <br />
As the bots are more effective, so are GMs. They require less and less proof every day. They can't ban you because you're in a botters spot (like gs tomb 1st floor on 20+lvl), you're on Pskonejott or cuz many ppl report you. <br />
But they CAN and will ban you for a delay in responding. If you manage to get your ass back to tibia in more than 10 seconds, you may expect a ban. It really depends on GM and your reputation. This is why it's important to stay below the radar all the time and keep your reputation clean. You cannot be a well-known botter or the slightest proof will be sufficient for a ban. You can't fool them with &quot;I was kicked&quot; or &quot; I was in toilet&quot;, don't count on that. You can make a conditional even that says &quot;hi&quot; and dances to buy you some time <br />
OnGMPause<br />
This option of cavebot pauses indeed, but attack on monster stays, this is how GMs see that you have been active recently. It also doesn't stop you from following the last waypoint. This option can't be trusted<br />
<br />
NEVER admit that you bot. Never even talk about cheating on forum, such thing as sarcasm doesn't exist for tibia rules enforcers, remember that. Once you post something wrong, you're on a 30 day vacation. Also, it&#8217;s better to ignore people and make stupid excuses then admit you&#8217;re botting. Only admitting can harm you even farther.<br />
<br />
Auto-responding<br />
Sometimes it&#8217;s better to make a conditional event with &#8220;leave please I&#8217;m hunting here, cya&#8221; once a player enters screen (with 10000 lock after done at least) then to set up an auto responder. The reason is that with auto-responder the conversation may look like<br />
-hello<br />
-hi<br />
-bot?<br />
-no<br />
-bot?<br />
-no<br />
-bot?<br />
-no<br />
And so on. Once player spam a keyword he&#8217;ll know at once you&#8217;re botting. If you say a msg once and then ignore him, he&#8217;ll never be sure. Keeping players uncertain is how you gain an advantage. <br />
<br />
Few basic things about complains &#8211; Gm answer before Senior Gm, only complain function on tibia.com site works there. Use support@tibia.com (if I got e-mail wrong, shame on me, ask around on help board :D) only in case of forum bans, which are dealt by customer support members. Don&#8217;t give up, you may receive a &#8220;No&#8221; at first complain msg and a &#8220;Yes&#8221; at another.  Knowledge of tibia rules, &#8220;art of arguing&#8221; and perfect English are three keys to successful complain. <br />
If you have a problem with writing one, you can PM me, I&#8217;ll do my best to help you. I got those three keys and it would be an interesting experience for me to write more complains and see results. <br />
 <br />
It turned out to be quite long and chaotic but I&#8217;m sure all of you have learnt something from it. Except those who skipped to the very end :D<br />

(first one better for GMs but you won't auto heal)<br />
<br />
in hotkeys<br />
That way once you hear alarm, hit ESC, and besides stopping from WALKING AND ATTACKING, you also stop auto-action.<br />

The other things are the ones I do, I never got a Ban, except for my AFKers Moneymakers</div></div><hr />

Botting at pvp-enforced wouldn't be your best idea. Any kill stealing or ignoring hi/leave msg mean    pvp fight. Keep your ding on msg alarm on to make sure you answer any time someone talks to you. Keep your bleep on player on screen alarm so you're ready for incoming attack:D. I don't even have to mention you should stay near pc, do I? Getting &quot;hiscore&quot; at pskonejott can make ppl pay you a visit, and then even if you respond, they might not want the travel time go to waste and attack anyways. :D Stay below the radar all the time. Once you get noticed, they'll all hunt you down<br />

this thread let me know something about you...you have never played in a pvp enforced server cya</div></div><hr />
