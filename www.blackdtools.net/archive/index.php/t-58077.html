I have been lurking on this site for a few days now just reading about the tools available and reading some of the guides etc. I'm currently playing Tibia manually just to waste some time at work :p.

Tibia is pretty unforgiving when it comes to dying huh? It's not exactly good at explaining things to you" />

Tibia is pretty unforgiving when it comes to dying huh? It's not exactly good at explaining things to you either....once I chose to be a warrior I literally had no idea what to do next until I found a quest had appeared in my log.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not trying to make millions of gold and get all the best gear in the game overnight but I would like to try and make back my gold asap :D. Thinking of giving the Blackd Safe Cheats a try but it looks pretty complicated.....and I don't really want to get myself banned. I know there is always the risk of that but I don't want it to happen because I set something incorrectly.<br />
<br />
Is there a good guide to get me started with Safe Cheats?</div></div><hr />

<br />
people who get banned using BlackD are generally people who use the cavebot function, i would help you out but i got random pked on a new char and on the way to get bless and dropped my softboots (400k) ._.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pandorum</div><div class="date">05-14-2012, 00:08</div></div><div class="posttext">I lost nothing like 400k so I can't even imagine what that must feel like. I'll check out BSC and see what it can do to get me started again :p.<br />
<br />
Is there no way to get your items back when you die? or some kind of softcore mode where the only punishment is loss of exp?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to kill Rats, Cave Rats and Bats in a cave below Thais (while sat at the computer). Does anyone have an example script I could look at please? I think I can kind of reverse engineer it to suit my needs if you see what I mean but trying to figure it out from scratch on my own is a little beyond me at this time in the morning :D. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah i only have a free account. I chose my started city to be Thais and I can't find any good spots with a good flow of mobs to fight. Except for the sewers below the town of course.</div></div><hr />

I went to the trolls yesterday but then remembered I had lost my shovel during my exploring expedition lol. I'm in the sewers at the moment trying to get enough money together to get a new one.</div></div><hr />

Managed to return there a third time and get all my things back. Phew.</div></div><hr />
