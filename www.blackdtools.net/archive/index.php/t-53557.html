There are still CMs no more GMs but I guess CMs can ban straight up if they come across you</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">udarr</div><div class="date">02-24-2011, 15:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, is it possible to add something like refiler to this tool ? I'm training on target dummies and it's nice when I turn on 2 BlackD Hotkeys aplications. Fist eat food, second is manaburning. Everything is ok, but...I must refil small stones manualy. I know that this tool just 'push hotkey' and refiling is completly different thing - tool shall be like my mouse - take stones from 1st place in main bp and take it to hand, than click enter/ok to confirm ammount of stones which will be moved to hand.<br />
I used tasker to do this but actually I scary about ban with using it cuz it repeat mouse moving it the same time...Oposite of grate BlackD tool which is making action in random time so it avoid ban.</div></div><hr />
