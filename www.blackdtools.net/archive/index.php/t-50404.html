I used it back in the old days to login to tibia (if you are from the old days, you would know why - no login waitlist, instead, you have to try again and again when the server is full).<br />
<br />
But this reminded me of SCAR (Shite Compared to Auto Rune), a runescape macro based on some programming (much more usefull/complex than tasker) <br />
It has a hell loads of functions, and I was just wondering, if it's possible to make a &quot;cavebot&quot; using SCAR? I have used it to minimize bps before after serversave login and made other simple 'conds' like autologout, eating meat, runemaking, fishing etc. <br />
well my point is that this runescape macro withstood the test of time - being a standalone bot that survived all runescape updates (yes I know runescape / Jagex sucks but this is just and idea).<br />
<br />
what do you guys think about SCAR?<br />
I suck at programming so is it be possible to make a decent cavebot script with it?<br />
and it would be undetectable right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Back in the day i would use it to train my pally or just camp a random druid and train his magic level all day<br />
But can they detect marcos?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pater</div><div class="date">05-19-2010, 23:45</div></div><div class="posttext">from time to time  i use autohotkey tasker without any randomization to train my pally and didn't get banned ( about 3 ban waves ) so i think they could't detect it .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luzorur</div><div class="date">05-22-2010, 04:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Used ir to train this time, one set of training chars used tasker, which doesn't have any randomization and other using SCAR, with almost all values using the &quot;random()&quot; function and guess what none of them got banned this time. <br />
Although I know cip doesnt bans all and a few examples can't be used as proof however I'll try to make them more sophisticated and see if they survive future bans. <br />
<br />
well in my opinion they are almost undetectable, but if a programmer reads this can you tell me if it is possible in some ways to autodetect SCAR in tibia?? <br />
<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
heheh yeah but SCAR has an &quot;random(number)&quot; function that deals with the 'randomness' xD<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
wait (2316+random(4321)) &lt;- waits 2316 miliseconds plus a random time between 0 and 4321, in miliseconds<br />
<br />
or another example:<br />
clickmouse (666+random(10), 555+random(10))<br />
clicks mouse in the coordinates 666,555 with a 0 to 10 variation each time :D<br />
<br />
ofcourse tasker has no repetiveness whatsoever, whereas SCAR got a lot pretty nice functions! :cool:<br />
the only problem now is that I am a really sucky programmer so now I've only programmed some runemaking/fishing/eat minimize backpack etc simple programs xD<br />
<br />
I'd love to make a cavebot someday.. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah xD <br />
<br />
well right now I dont think cip is banning people based on repetitive actions, but probably in the near future they will<br />
<br />
hmm but I think it's possible... just that.... I dont think I have the time and knowledge to do it xD</div></div><hr />

agree with u, repetitive actions are not a base of banishment. as i wote in this thread i use autohotkey without randomization and havent got banned yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luzorur</div><div class="date">05-30-2010, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">so.. is there any way to detect SCAR or tasker?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knight jaki</div><div class="date">06-05-2010, 22:06</div></div><div class="posttext">u probably wont get banned(just, not yet, dno what cipsoft gonna do with it) if you know how to program that shit, you can make pretty cool things with it.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
omg botting on a cellphone!?!?!!?!?!<br />
<br />
lol i think im not getting used to the fast pace of '''technological''' advances XDDD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tekop</div><div class="date">07-25-2010, 18:21</div></div><div class="posttext">its not botting on the phone its just using an emulator :P</div></div><hr />
