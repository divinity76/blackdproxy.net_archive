Update 07-07-2010:<br />
<br />
 <br />
Well IMO theres always been a &quot;slow&quot; community on here. As you can also see, I always see familiar faces around here. Weve had the same community for years, a couple have left, but theres been a lot of people that has come. I just find that the fault is in ourselves, since we dont post that much (Ive noticed that within myself) lately.<br />
Maybe we should be the ones that must start the change?<br />
<br />
 <br />
I'd say some contests from Blackd himself, paying gold in the world the winner is or something like that<br />
And also a new layout... But you wouldn't be forced to use, just choose what you like the most and use it...<br />
<br />
 <br />
old mate ;)<br />
I like it to, I just feel that the talking topics of this forum are simply dead, more anatractive.<br />
I think contest would be a great iniciative.<br />
I mean who dont like to win something and it brings friendship to the random talks, a live chat would be a suggestion to :)<br />
<br />
 <br />
CONTEST!!! lol We're all so helpful and nice usually... sometimes.... and less flaming would be nice but meh. <br />
Like the choose your layout idea tho.<br />
<br />
<br />
My proposals<br />
<br />
 The Site should always be fast loading<br />
 Make your website easy to navigate<br />
 Use suitable colors/skins<br />
 Don't overuse Pop-ups<br />
 Remember your purpose<br />
 Have an “Advertise with Us” Banner on your site. This is the single most important issue. It should click to an Advertising information page and have an easy way to contact you for more information and rates. Key points: Make it a graphical image or a tab. Keep it above the fold. <br />
 Show your site stats.You need to show at least the basics for site statical information: Monthly unique visitors and total number of impressions are the 2 key ones. Other less important can be Google PR &amp; Alexa rank. <br />
 User demographic information. Know your audience. The bare minimum is Male/Female % and average age of your readers. Other potentially useful information includes geographic, HHI, single/married, number of kids. etc. How do you get this info? You can do site polls, survey’s, or get more detailed stats from ComScore or Quantcast.com <br />
 Don’t use Google AdSense on your site. OK, this could be the most painful one for most people especially if you are generating a few hundred bucks a month from it already. But Google ad sense devalues your site and makes it look unprofessional. You have to ask yourself, “Do I want some real revenue from my site or Google’s table scraps.” <br />
 Keep your blog professional.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill try to contact blackd and let him see the suggestions</div></div><hr />

I think we need is some fresh news some talking topics to be attractive, and a live chat can bring random fun talk to everyone, its far quick to answer and get news from everyone.<br />
<br />
and Im still betting on the contests. :)<br />

We used to be a big community back in the times when  BlackD proxy was the most amazing bot out there. However things have changed nowadays. Many people don't even bot anymore since cipsoft started autodetecting cheaters and the ones who still do, use some other tools which offer them better more and better features. Just have a look at some more popular bot forums and see how many people they have online...<br />
that is just my opinion...</div></div><hr />

The only way to get people back is to have a new blackd bot. It also doesnt help that a lot of people have quit playing tibia since the last few updates.

In my eyes non of this facts will get the activity too much higher.<br />
The thing is that this has once been a botting forum, now that blackd is kinda outdated its only used by non blackd'ers to gain new hunting grounds from our knowledge.<br />
The current main problem of the forum is that its used by sooo less ppl.<br />
Less flaming won't call too much new members.<br />
Maybe it should be made more interested like fansites.<br />
Easy obtainable infos about general questions for example.<br />
Also there could be &quot;payments&quot; for projekts beeing on for a while so that we get more projekts running <br />
(usual ppl start a projekt and quit it after 2 weeks)<br />
Also posts like &quot;wow ur dooing so amazing&quot; are simply annoying in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Well i kinda lost the red line xD tv is taking my attention .. simpsons ftw<br />

Answer: Yes.<br />
<br />
It explains itself. If Tibia is dead then the bot sites dies also. It makes 100% sense.<br />
Don't you remember how many ppl there was here before CIP implemented the anti bot/cheat thingy? There where full of people here.. After bots got detected, people had no business here what so ever.<br />

That may be true. But I liked it more with new threads and people everyday than the same 20~~ ppl all the time.. I mean.. We're here just to talk about random stuffs and almost nothing have to do with Tibia. &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

There are no updates on any tool for a long time, not even for Blackd safe cheats. I remember when it came out, the forum become more active but suddenly, all that activity stopped. And why? The tools could not satisfy the looking or the need of the players, making them move to the concurrence.<br />
This is my opinion and i believe it transmits the problem of this hole community. Changing this will definitely change this forum for a better thing.<br />
<br />
Note: In one email that i sent to Blackd he answered me he might update Blackd safe cheats for the Christmas update. Food eater and probably a simple rune maker. But its not a sure yet :)</div></div><hr />
