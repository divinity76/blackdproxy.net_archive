<br />
Is it possible to make the bot &quot;ignore&quot; the blocked tiles on map or something like that? I really need this to work.<br />
I really like this bot and I want to use it.<br />
<br />
And I also wonder how I can make the bot open next bp if the first one is full?<br />
have some other questions too but dont wanna spam you with 5 questions in a row.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- make waypoint every step, so bot will step in to the field (i see on another topic its not possible)<br />
- make condition if 'my position' = 'my position' for x seconds, then give some random steps<br />
<br />
and found this:<br />

About open next bp when its full, i think its better to open all bp minimized, it should work<br />

Ask everything at once so I can get some time to study about it</div></div><hr />

I will try to fix this tibia.dat thing, thx!<br />
EDIT: I found &quot;blocking path&quot; in dateditor and I removed it, but still the same problem.. :/<br />
EDITEDIT: after a while of buggin the sprites ingame and so on I finally fixed it. It can walk on fire fields now.<br />
<br />
 open next backpack and minisize it doesent help tho.<br />
<br />
so my other questions: <br />
Is there any option about hold target?<br />
my mwall timer doesent work..<br />
I miss the option to see invisible monsters, is this possible to fix?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oclipper</div><div class="date">11-14-2014, 22:03</div></div><div class="posttext">hold target - i idk what do you mean, you can set it as hotkey (there is a bug with creatures with same name on the screen)<br />
<br />
mw timer - disabled by default, i think blackDaniel is busy and has no interest to add new features on blackd since it leads u a ban for unkown reasons<br />
<br />
invisible - its impossible to see invisible creature on newer tibia versions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me ask you, do you play ot or RL servers? <br />
what do you like in blackd ng?<br />
which do you prefer, cavebot features or war features?<br />
do u have any proposal?<br />
what do you hate in blackd ng?</div></div><hr />

ah okey I understand. Im using it for 8.6 ot servers because I think Elfbot is too much shit.<br />
its good but its old and all those scripts making me so confused.<br />
(I know how to use elfbot till 100% but its just annoying with all the &quot;hotkeys&quot; and stuff,<br />
its too much.)<br />
<br />
I like the NG because its simple, looks good and its not too much in it.<br />
I like the cavebot and Extras n healing mostly atm.<br />
hm.. proposal: fix the magic wall timer and maybe spelltimers?<br />
maybe add more settings for how you wanna kill the monster and stuff?<br />
<br />
What I hate is the small bugs with it. mana shield doesent work.<br />
the mapclick error with fields. (fixed it by changing .dat file in tibia)<br />
<br />
I dont know what to say. there is alot more you can do to this, If  you want. haha</div></div><hr />

OMG i think elfbot is the best bot for war ever. Elfbot use to work with hotkeys instead check box with &quot;auto utamo&quot; for example, but with elfbot howkeys you have infinite possibilities.<br />
<br />
Blackdbot classic is soo complicated that only ppls with sufficient programming knowleage can handle with it, so I did simplify things and now we have blackd ng, there still some bugs like auto utamo due to blackd bot be multclient.<br />
<br />
I just use blackd for new tibia clients to bind hotkeys, avoing cooldown and antipush cuz its works on shadowcores. Now Tibia players wants &quot;undetectable bots&quot; so im working on blackd safe cheats, have a look:<br />

<br />
im starting to work and develop a bot from zero, blackd ng source has MANY usuless/outdated things/functions etc and its totally detectable. but even on tp forums developers are not motivated since tibia last shit updates, the game is in decay</div></div><hr />
