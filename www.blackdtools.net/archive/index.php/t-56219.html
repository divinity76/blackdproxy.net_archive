What I came here to ask is if there are more people than me that's interested in &quot;Paid to&quot;-sites, where you make money clicking links, reading e-mails and completing surveys and the like. I've found a few that look good (and ofcourse I made scripts so I don't need to bother clicking links... :D).<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone else knows of any such sites that are guaranteed to pay. I'm especially interested in sites that use &quot;Surfbars&quot;, applications that run in the background and show advertisments while paying you money.<br />
<br />
So, is there anyone?<br />
<br />
P.S. For anyone interested, I could share my scripts (made in GreaseMonkey for Firefox) to anyone that's agree to be my referral. Being a referral means I get between 1-10% of what you earn as a bonus, without you losing any of your earnings.<br />
<br />
P.S.2 This is not a fast way to make money, but if you've got time it could be worth it, especially if you use some kind of script or bot.<br />
<br />
Humbly yours,<br />

However, I have made some scripts using GreaseMonkey (an add-on for Firefox) that will click these links for you, so all you have to do is basically to keep a tab open with the site(s) and let the script do the job of clicking links, which means you'll be making money just having the browser open.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to share the scripts I use and help you set it up if you agree to be a referral to me, which means I'll get a small bonus from the money you make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it's dead and been that way for a while. But I still know alot of people here and alot of people know of me, so I figured I'd give it a try and see what people thought.<br />
Right now I'm not really on any site, other than Facebook, 'cause I've got a lame ass computer I can't play games on.<br />

Heheh. As I said, this comp stays on 24/7, so doing this won't cost me a thing.<br />

Just check that one I said on msn.</div></div><hr />

You could just run two instances of Firefox (if that's your main browser). It doesn't really affect your computer at all while running.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got 3 or 4 cents on each website (there are 3 running atm). The thing that makes u grow is spreading the referral links.</div></div><hr />

I've been paid by some but not others, so it's all about picking the right one.</div></div><hr />
