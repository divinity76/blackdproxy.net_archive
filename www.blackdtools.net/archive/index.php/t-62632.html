 Pardon my ignorance if I'm wrong, but I think the $lastcheckresult$ should return a string when you look something on X,Y,Z. Is that right ?<br />

The thing is, it executes the exiva check properly, but when it comes to $lastcheckresult$ it never returns anything from the exiva check. I even went to the Events to check what exactly $lastcheckresult$ was returning and it was returning NOTHING. It actually was returning that kind of message right above the chat (not possible, you're full etc), which I THINK it's not what it's supposed to do.<br />
<br />
So if anyone can test to see if it's really working, please tell me :D<br />
<br />
If you want I can post the part of the door opener scripts just for you guys to see if there's any error there, but I think the code is just fine.<br />
<br />
If it's working and I'm just stupid, you can close/delete the thread ;c<br />
