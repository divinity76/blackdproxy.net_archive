UPDATED: Had one waitX 5 for windows too much. Script now 5 seconds faster. ;) Also made it better restartable, if you get kicked while hunting rats you just restart it no problems. Sheep already worked. If you get kicked while buying EQ or something just finish that yourself and go down to Al Dee rats or use exiva jump 244.<br />
UPDATED: Remove apple check since it bugged.<br />
UPDATED: A few mistakes in checks corrected. Doesn't buy backpack if you went through tutorial. No auto-chase in client, works better. Just sets full attack.<br />
UPDATED: Checked for 97 gp while at Willie's but not counting right if the meats and hams looted were enough, like supposed to. Now fixed.<br />
<br />
Also contains AutoRook as did my Automated Tutorial Script (http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?57394-Automated-Rookgard-Tutorial). It doesn't do much here other than telling you what's going on, close the windows that comes up if you want it in it's own channel. Otherwise client will spam you when you close them. :p Also it should be alot safer if you close the windows even if it works otherwise. There's just two of them and they are in the start so just wait 15 seconds at the most before going AFK.<br />
The bot will wait for five seconds every time a window comes up for waitX 5 so you can close them if you're cautious.<br />
<br />
Please comment! And ofcourse all kind of bugreports are appreciated! :cool:</div></div><hr />

I think you should use exiva openbp instead of the exiva &gt; command.<br />
You don't get an apple after finishing the tutorial.<br />
Also, you've got two :openbag<br />

What does exiva &gt; BE do?<br />

Stops follow. So it doesn't screw up walking, which it sometimes does. :p Dunno if it stop other stuff too. Will try to take the time and look through your entire script soon and point out what you could do better... You got any tips for me?</div></div><hr />

What I changed:<br />
 I moved :buybackpack so it will try the whole process again, including saying hi etc. Now it doesn't matter if someone pushes you away.<br />
 Added $numbertohex1:{$myz$}$ to make it safer. Making it a bit more idiot proof. I started it at Al Dee's second floor. (Where z=6).<br />
 Changed the IfTrue line to use string instead of number.<br />
 fastExiva openbp instead of fastExiva &gt; 82 FF FF 03 00 00 26 0B 00 00<br />
 Added an extra waypoint because the bag has to close before exiva openbp can be used. Walking away is a simple way of making it close. :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If we go through it line by line we can make this script perfect and idiot proof.<br />
I think we've ironed out the major kinks now, I'll run it again now to try it but I don't enjoy testing. :p<br />
Add me on MSN if you want, or PM me.<br />
I also changed that part but well I didn't do much except fix the thing I said in last post, changed stuff to openbp. Moved the openbag to after sew-waypoint.</div></div><hr />

Make it move within 1 or 2 sqm of the move pos :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I got it correctly xD:<br />
<br />
ChaoticMovesON = within 2 sqms<br />
<br />
ChaoticMovesOFF = within 1 sqm<br />
<br />
So this would be usefull for like character getting to certain, exact spot ... Hum well, I've used these two before and I've noticed the difference but never knew what the difference was all about.<br />
<br />
Thanks, now I shall use these PROPERLY. :D</div></div><hr />

Yeah... ChaoticMovesOFF is old style walking, so usually get's it right but sometimes go one less or more sqm :P Chaotic Moves are great but useless for going to NPCs.</div></div><hr />

Worked for me last night on latest tibia 9.7. Although when i logged back on this morning (char got kicked due to server save) it was level 8.5 and still trying to kill rats.   Anyone know why this is? What level is it supposed to go to Isle of Destiny? where in the script the Hunt to level code is?

Anyways you should really take a look at the dates these scripts were posted and maybe instead of just copy and pasting and using Malmis' script use his as a reference and create a very basic one yourself, give yourself sword/shield and some armor and just make it loop, create all the waypoints by walking around typing exiva pos in your client, copy &amp; paste those to a note pad, specify what to kill at the top of your script with..ex setMeleeKill rat and when you get to the end of your loop the end of your script should say..ex gotoScriptLine 0  to restart at the beginning of your script. Big suggestion because I used to do it myself until I got the ban hammer and lost things, dont use others scripts try and make your own, <br />

Anyways you should really take a look at the dates these scripts were posted and maybe instead of just copy and pasting and using Malmis' script use his as a reference and create a very basic one yourself, give yourself sword/shield and some armor and just make it loop, create all the waypoints by walking around typing exiva pos in your client, copy &amp; paste those to a note pad, specify what to kill at the top of your script with..ex setMeleeKill rat and when you get to the end of your loop the end of your script should say..ex gotoScriptLine 0  to restart at the beginning of your script. Big suggestion because I used to do it myself until I got the ban hammer and lost things, dont use others scripts try and make your own, <br />

Of course like @Lithium said, try to write your own scripts, download them only to study how things are scripted by the others.<br />
<br />
And you don't have to copy/paste 'exiva pos' every time, just use 'exiva addmove', that will add the waypoint to the cavebot automaticaly.</div></div><hr />
