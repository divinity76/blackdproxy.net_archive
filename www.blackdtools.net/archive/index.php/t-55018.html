Here's what the site says:<br />
http://valhalla.otserv.co/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7.4 rocks. We bring you THE oldschool Tibia experience. Guaranteed.<br />
 We are here to stay. Your time won't be wasted.<br />
 Valhalla is the most realistic oldschool server. There's none better.<br />
 We actively hunt down and banish cheaters. Fair play wins the day.<br />
 Premium is inexpensive. Everyone can afford it.<br />
 Our server has an amazing uptime and stability, over 99.9% uptime!<br />
 We have years of experience running OT Servers.<br />
 You can't buy skills or levels. Everyone is equal.<br />
 Our staff is fair, mature, helpful and very experienced.<br />
 Our Tibia Server is up 24x7, dedicated hosting at 100mbit/s.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've played this server some time now, and what I can say about it:<br />
*No annoying bugs like other OT's have, they have original tibia files which means damage, loot, etc is 100% correct.<br />
*Based on 7.7 client - which means low amount of cheaters. Few ppl getting banned  for bot but the major bots don't work here.<br />
*7.7 client means dx9/opengl - no low fps because of old client.<br />
*ALL quests works, exactly as rl tibia oldschool.<br />
<br />
So if you like oldschool tibia, join! :p</div></div><hr />
