Goal: We need a reliable way to determine the selected row in the character list.<br />
Purpose: This small &quot;stupid&quot; part is important for proxy bots, tibiacast and many other software that depends on packets. <br />
 <br />
This is my current progress:<br />
<br />
- I could not find a reliable path that always contain the selector. However, there seems to be a path that works for the first show of the character list:<br />
&quot;Qt5Gui.dll&quot;+00482EE4 &gt; 20 &gt; C &gt; 58 &gt; 4 &gt; F8 &gt; 418<br />
This is not a full solution. However, this path maybe could mean something.<br />
- In a fast look to the assembly code, it looks like the real path must end in <br />
X &gt; 418<br />
or<br />
X &gt; 3DC &gt; 4 &gt; DC<br />
Why? Because if you toggle breakpoint at<br />
Qt5Quick.QQuickMouseEvent::y+91C0<br />
then you can verify both paths are valid while execution is paused at that point:<br />
[EBX+4] &gt; 3DC &gt; 4 &gt; DC<br />
[EBX+4] &gt; 418<br />
The problem is [EBX+4] is overwritten with trash after the execution is resumed. :(<br />
It could be the start of a solution with the help of injection tactics. However I prefer to avoid injection for now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some related findings:<br />
I already found a stable way to obtain character list: http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?62978-Tibia-11-Collection-of-server-info-AND-character-list It does not include a way to know selection. However, I guess the selection must be somewhere near that list. We need to investigate around.<br />
<br />
I also found a stable way to read Tibia title after login.<br />
adrSelectedCharName=&quot;Qt5Core.dll&quot; + 004555C8 &gt; 8 &gt; C &gt; 4 &gt; 18 &gt; 38 &gt; 28<br />
adrSelectedCharName points to a QSTRING with character name. If you are outside game then it will point to null (address FFFFFFF) or to an address containing an empty qstring &quot;&quot; <br />
<br />
I also found a way to pause everything in Tibia client using Cheat Engine: Memory View&gt; Debug &gt; Break &gt; Select first thread in the list &gt; OK<br />
Pausing Tibia during char list inspection is great because other way the memory there seems to be changing a lot with each selection change. It also prevents char list window to go away because inactivity.<br />
<br />
More facts:<br />
- Somewhere in the memory there seems to be 3 chaotic places that hold the selection color for each row. <br />
F4F4F4FF = COLOR SELECTED<br />
C0C0C0FF = COLOR FOR ROW NOT SELECTED<br />
Search array of bytes in Cheat Engine to discover them. If we can find the structure that links all the color positions then we could obtain selection from the color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-04-2016, 22:20</div></div><div class="posttext">A new interesting discovery today:<br />
adrSelectedItem_currentScreenPositionY=&quot;Qt5Widgets.dll&quot; + 00401DC4 &gt; 70 &gt; 4 &gt; 68<br />
points to a 8 bytes DOUBLE, containing the Y position of the selected row.<br />
<br />
More data around:<br />
adrSelectedItem_currentScreenPositionX=&quot;Qt5Widgets .dll&quot; + 00401DC4 &gt; 70 &gt; 4 &gt; 60<br />
adrSelectedItem_width=&quot;Qt5Widgets.dll&quot; + 00401DC4 &gt; 70 &gt; 4 &gt; a0<br />
adrSelectedItem_height=&quot;Qt5Widgets.dll&quot; + 00401DC4 &gt; 70 &gt; 4 &gt; a8</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DiegoTV</div><div class="date">10-05-2016, 04:09</div></div><div class="posttext">With the latter you could easily find a way to figure out the SelectedIndex quite easily, don't you think?<br />
I haven't had the time to work around it though I'll try to make some now and post a code snippet if I get it to work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-05-2016, 10:07</div></div><div class="posttext">The only problem with the selected item is that it depends on 2 things:<br />
- current client height: You would need to determine current client height and include it in your maths.<br />
- popup Y position: If someone drag and move the Character Selection popup then the selected item position will change too. <br />
<br />
Even if you can do proper maths with everything I am afraid this solution will not work after the character list is gone.<br />
For my proxy I need to read selected character between character selection and ingame. I know there must be a way to read current selection in any moment. Other way client would not be able to restore current selection after logout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-09-2016, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a solution that works for me.<br />
This allows to check selected char exactly after user selected a char:<br />
<br />
adrSelectedCharName_afterCharList=&quot;Qt5Core.dll&quot; + 004555C8 &gt; 8 &gt; 320 &gt; 18 &gt; 60 &gt; 0<br />
adrSelectedServerURL_afterCharList=&quot;Qt5Core.dll&quot; + 004555C8 &gt; 8 &gt; 320 &gt; 18 &gt; 60 &gt; 4<br />
adrSelectedServerPORT_afterCharList=&quot;Qt5Core.dll&quot; + 004555C8 &gt; 8 &gt; 320 &gt; 18 &gt; 60 &gt; 8<br />
adrSelectedServerNAME_afterCharList=&quot;Qt5Core.dll&quot; + 004555C8 &gt; 8 &gt; 320 &gt; 18 &gt; 60 &gt; C<br />
<br />
This should allow proxy bots to redirect connection to right game server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-31-2016, 22:11</div></div><div class="posttext">not, really. But that is the value you would get if you check adrSelectedItem_height when you are connected while you do not open any menu.<br />
Maybe the first mseconds after loading might reach that case, maybe not. Anyways it does not hurt to leave it there, just in case.</div></div><hr />
