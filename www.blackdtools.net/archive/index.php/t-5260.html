<br />
<br />
 First off, you will have to download this program (http://www.dbpoweramp.com/dmc.htm) and install it.<br />
 Once you've installed it, locate the file you want to use as your custom sound. Right-click on the file and select &quot;Convert To&quot;.<br />
 A new window will pop up. Select the right settings according to the picture: <br />
<br />
http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/329/convertvr5.jpg<br />
 Once you've selected the right settings, just press &quot;Convert &gt;&gt;&quot;.<br />
 Now you will have to go to your &quot;BlackD Proxy&quot;-folder and locate the sound you want to replace.<br />
 Backup the original file.<br />
 Now go back to the converted file and replace its name with the file you just backupped. (If you backupped &quot;danger.wav&quot; then you should name the converted file to &quot;Danger.wav&quot;)<br />
 Copy your new &quot;Danger.wav&quot; to your &quot;BlackD Proxy&quot;-folder. You are ready to try it out!<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Exiva Cancel won't always stop the sound. Let's say you have a song which is 2:00 long. The alarm starts and you write &quot;Exiva Cancel&quot; 10 seconds after the song started to play. The sound won't stop until it has reached its end (1:50 remaining).<br />
