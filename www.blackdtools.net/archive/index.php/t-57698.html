	<meta name="description" content="Hello, 
 
I would like to put in 2 requests for scripts. The first being the barbarian town at Krimhorn, just waypoints going around town on ground level would suffice, and make blood walker +2 and brutetamer +1. I can set loot to my liking. the second request is pirates at Nargor, just levels +1 and +2.  Also to have corsair +3, buccaneer +2, and cutthroat +1, once again i can manage setting the loot. Thank you ahead of time.." />
