All this does is send my hotkeys to the game when my mana or health drops below a value. Its kind of a cheap mans auto heal / mana restore made for test server :P.<br />
<br />
But it got me to thinking , if this was implemented into a bot like blackd (using postmessage api instead of send keys so it worked when tibia was out of focus) then surely no bot detector can see this.It is simulating a human 100% by pressing the hotkey and not changing any data at all within tibia. <br />
<br />
Of course with massive progs like blackd theres other methods that can get you banned but i see no disadvantage to this code , on test server I have been to poi , pharoes , demons and all sorts with this little bot running , it works fine I feel just as safe as blackds auto heal (with the exception of it not working out of focus due to my own lazyness in using sendkeys and not postmessage)</div></div><hr />

I also added a lighthack to it (just because blackd was down the past few days this script worked on the new game version with no changes what so ever since the test sever version) but generally its intended to be used along side blackd.<br />

here's an exp counter I did (and still is working on), it should give you all the necessary code bits (clientchooser.cs contains getting PID and whatnot) except the sending hotkeys thing, although you just need to import the API through P/Invoke and then call it<br />
<br />
it's for 7.4 though:<br />

<br />
Probably the only way to do this is either take control of the mouse cursor to mapclick or send api packets to tell the client where to mouse clicked..<br />
<br />
or the last option (currently known to me)<br />
is to send a hell of alot arrow keys to the client<br />

I have used this now for many levels and on test servers + if you look at tibia.exe with a debugger (I use softice but ollydbg will do) there is no api reading going on. This would be easy to bypass with a ring 0 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28computer_security%29) driver if it happened but it does not.<br />
<br />
P.S new client released about 1 minutes ago , new offsets if you are using this and want a bot until blackd updates are as follows (8.56):<br />
<br />
thehpadress = &quot;&amp;H63FE8C&quot;<br />
<br />
thempadress = &quot;&amp;H63FE70&quot;<br />
<br />
It seems the hp amount is always +1C(h) mana address.</div></div><hr />
