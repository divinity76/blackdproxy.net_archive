What are those &quot;bugs&quot; you're speaking of?<br />
The cavebot acts differently now to avoid getting detected on real servers. This is only the default setting though, and can be changed.<br />
Apply the following lines on top lines of your script:<br />
<br />
<br />
setBot OldLootMode=1<br />
setChaoticMovesOFF<br />
<br />
Might be something else I have missed, but give it a try.</div></div><hr />

The problem is the bot just runs around like a moron and can be trapped by crates now adays it will run over fire fields like its drawn to them and even wander off down ladders/holes to their certain doom! lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vescape</div><div class="date">08-26-2011, 12:37</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the answers, but the cavebot is still acting weird when using those settings you wrote zmulan :(<br />
<br />
the thing is, the bot doesn't kill monsters when it is walking to a waypoint, so you have to make weird scripts for it to work good. it doesn't walk over poison etc.<br />
<br />
where can i login to download the old files? I think I still have a working account</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vescape</div><div class="date">08-28-2011, 13:42</div></div><div class="posttext">not possible? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">08-28-2011, 19:56</div></div><div class="posttext">if bot does not attack a monster that is probably because you took more than 40 seconds to kill it and then it added it to ignore list.<br />
you might want to increase the default limit of 40000 ms to kill monsters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vescape</div><div class="date">08-28-2011, 20:21</div></div><div class="posttext">that is not the problem, I already have that in my script. and also setChaoticMovesOFF and setBot OldLootMode=1, however the bot doesn't really work as good as it did before :/<br />
<br />
so i am just wondering if there is any place to download an older version? thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zmulan</div><div class="date">08-28-2011, 22:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some testing and it actually seems like something is wierd, my character was just running to the next waypoint and ignored creatures that popped on screen (had it on meleeKill)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vescape</div><div class="date">08-29-2011, 19:40</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah thats what i mean, it sometimes just ignores the monsters and goes to the next waypoint and then kill the creatures, but then you already miss some kills when you run away from monsters :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vescape</div><div class="date">09-05-2011, 16:41</div></div><div class="posttext">there has to be some place to get the old clients? please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vescape</div><div class="date">09-07-2011, 19:47</div></div><div class="posttext">bump! daniel don't you have the old installers? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">09-14-2011, 01:39</div></div><div class="posttext">A recent blackd update (fixing attack packet spam, to be precise) will probably fix the problem of bot not attacking monsters... most 7.6/7.7 and possibly other OTs, will reset the &quot;2 sec exhaust&quot; each time a attack packet is being sent, and thus when blackd was spamming attack packet, on those OTs, blackD never attacked.. but as said, it was fixed in a recent update iirc.</div></div><hr />
