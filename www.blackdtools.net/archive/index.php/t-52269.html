Places you need for example a key or so  to enter, like theese sick ones in kazz witch I don't know much about, please don't answer Black knight quest or Fibula because everyone knows them :p 
Pretty much places you can't get into within 15 minutes if you are not sick in the head!

Carlin graveyard - I think a lot of people know this place BUT many people simply do not have a bone key so for them to get a bone key in &lt;15min will be quite a difficult job, this place has saved me alot of times :)<br />

Its the little room under Femor Hills with a quest door. There's a Goblin Leader there that I think will hold PZ lock on you but I'm not sure, maybe it works to X-log?<br />
