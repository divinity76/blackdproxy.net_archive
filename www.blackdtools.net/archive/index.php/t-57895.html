We do not have a definitive date yet as we are still working on this project. I<br />
can tell you however that it is not too much longer now, news about these servers<br />
should be released fairly soon, possibly before the Summer Update. We cannot be<br />
more specific at the moment as there is still some work to be done and it is<br />
possible that hiccups may influence the release of the servers. Rest assured that<br />
we will publish any news on the website as soon as it becomes available.<br />
<br />

<br />
Edit - May be related to the new poll &quot;are you talented at pvp?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-27-2012, 16:04</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, they are obviously analyzing the best place for the new servers. <br />
According to poll results I guess South America and Australia would be the best options.<br />
<br />
I also made some research and I found that character world transfer wont be possible there and it looks like they will run with alternative pvp system (hopefully old pvp rules)<br />

This was the last thing Craban posted:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Alternative PvP base system<br />
 I expect that I can pretty much get an ok for the general goals behind it, and I do not need an ok for the details anymore from the others, so it is likely that we will try this out.<br />
2. The development servers<br />
 I have also prepared a detailed concept for those. I want that to be done before because I want to use them to have this PvP system running in a test for a while and to fine tune it there. I will need an ok for the rough part of the concept and some programming time to get it done, so it will take a little while.<br />
3. Once we have that, we'll have the alternative system run there, fine tuned and released as soon as possible unless some major flaw shows during that phase.<br />
4. While we will be in that phase, I want to pick up on the rework of the unjust system.<br />
5. Parallel to that, I will get us started on the war system and PvP scoring concept of last year.<br />
6. The unjust system can then also go on the dev servers and the war system after that or at the same time, we'll see<br />
7. Once we are through with all that, then it is time to work on the vocation definitions and balancing using pretty much that same process again. I am however already now putting together the concept including the feedback from the public discussion we already had about the definitions<br />
8. As last priority of the ones mentioned here, I will pick up again on the idea of the 0 PvP death penalty as new server type, but it will be quite a while until then, realistically speaking probably not before the end of the year.</div></div><hr />

Preview Game Worlds - What to expect?<br />
<br />
Our plan is to put up two preview game worlds in the near future, one located in our European data centre, and the other in our American data centre. These two new worlds will be like regular Open PvP worlds at the beginning but with two major differences:<br />
<br />
Character world transfers will not be possible, players will neither be able to transfer to or away from those game worlds.<br />
Moreover, double experience points and double skill training will be enabled permanently there.<br />
<br />
Except for these two differences, these game worlds will be exactly like all other game worlds. As soon as we go in a preview phase, though, a further condition will apply to them: Due to the fact that we plan to run previews of not-yet-released features there, which are still in development, we cannot guarantee constant functionality. So these game worlds may be subject to resets as they become necessary during preview phases.<br />
Yet, this does not mean that resets will be a daily occurrence on preview game worlds. As long as they are not in a preview phase, they will not differ from other game worlds in that aspect. Also, a preview phase is only temporary, it is not a permanent state. What it means is, that once in a preview phase, we may have to reset these worlds to the start of that phase. So players will not have to start from scratch again in case of such a reset. Moreover, we intend to avoid resets if possible, and we do not plan to put on features there without having them tested internally ourselves. We also know from previous update tests that major problems which require a reset are usually discovered within hours or days at a max which means that the progress players may lose will most likely not exceed one or two days.<br />
<br />
We plan to continue testing new content mainly in private and public tests just like now but we want to use preview game worlds for testing bigger feature sets, especially controversial ones. This allows us to test such features earlier during the development phase and decoupled from update cycles.<br />
Of course, whenever a preview is released on a preview game world, we will inform the community about it in advance. Also, we will explicitly point players to the special conditions of preview game worlds during the character creation process there.<br />
<br />
While we hope to get lots of player feedback about previewed features on the two respective world boards of these game worlds, we will not only rely on direct feedback, but also gather data by measuring stuff and effects of tweaks and adjustments during a preview phase. Nevertheless, we also consider these two new world boards a promising channel for direct exchange between developers and players from time to time. So our developers may also open up feedback threads there and exchange opinions with players about features in question or other stuff they would like to put up for discussion.<br />
<br />
What does the schedule look like from here on out?<br />
<br />
While we cannot give you a concrete date yet, we plan to set up the new game worlds sometime later this month. Also, we hope to be able to launch the first preview in the near future: our proposal for an alternative PvP rule set. This concept evolved internally and was inspired by all the topics, problems and suggestions that came up in numerous, heated in-depth discussions with the focus group. Dedicated focus group members also helped us to tweak it further, and since we did not find a common ground on all aspects, the preview game worlds are a great chance to try out different solutions and see their effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, we already presented our plan to set up preview game worlds to the focus group a while ago, when we still referred to them as development servers. Opinions and feedback differed quite a lot. While some players welcomed the approach and our plan, others voiced doubts and concerns. For example, they forecast that players will be fighting for control over these worlds and thus, that chaos will ensue there. However, since the first preview will be all about PvP, we need all that: fights, warring guilds, struggle for power. In the end, we can only come up with fair yet thrilling and challenging solutions for all sides, rulers and ruled, predators and prey, oppressors, oppressed and neutrals, if there is an authentic PvP environment we can analyse.<br />
Other focus group members pointed out that many players will only be interested in getting high level characters and not care about giving valuable feedback. As mentioned earlier, we will not only rely on written feedback but also collect data. Furthermore, if you are concerned about the quality of feedback, take that as one more incentive to start a character there and contribute with constructive feedback. If you think you do not have enough time to start yet another character besides those you already play actively, just give it a try. Even if you can only play from time to time on preview game worlds, the permanent double experience and double skill training will certainly help you to get a decent level quickly for testing new features.<br />
<br />
All in all, we need a proper community on the preview game worlds before we can launch a preview. In order to go through with our plan, enough players have to start a character and play there. So we really need YOU! We need your feedback, your expertise, your passion!<br />
If you are looking for a fresh start, like trying out new things and facing new challenges, the preview game worlds might be just right for you! But even if you have doubts about them and how things will evolve, make a character there, share your opinion and experiences with us. We need your input and honest feedback for we want to improve Tibia together with you!<br />
<br />
Stay tuned!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Szyna111</div><div class="date">05-07-2012, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">@Daniel: I don't think that they will locate one of this new servers in Australia. It's due to low players from that part of world and also point of this servers is to test new features with highest possible amount of players.<br />
I think that best places to put that servers are South America and Europe because we all know that most players come from there ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">05-07-2012, 20:39</div></div><div class="posttext">One will be USA one will be europe. It says by the end of the world names...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-07-2012, 20:43</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, it is now confirmed that it will be 1 in USA and 1 in Europe. Anyways I would add at least 20 servers more or else the 2 new servers are going to be full with big queues 24/7 :)</div></div><hr />
