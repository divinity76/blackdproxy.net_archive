I was wondering what these new members would like to see? 
 
Rather than us posting the answer again and again on lots of threads would you like brand new tutorial pages being posted? 
 
There are still the old tutorials which will work perfectly... in the tutorial section... But I don't think anyone has looked there in along time. 
 
Maybe a tutorial on using the search" />

I was wondering what these new members would like to see?<br />
<br />
Rather than us posting the answer again and again on lots of threads would you like brand new tutorial pages being posted?<br />
<br />
There are still the old tutorials which will work perfectly... in the tutorial section... But I don't think anyone has looked there in along time.<br />
<br />
Maybe a tutorial on using the search function inside the forum?<br />
<br />
Or maybe some people want to see bot projects with linked in tutorials? <br />
<br />
With the new preview worlds coming out tomorrow maybe we could bring back a blackd team on one of those worlds?<br />
<br />
Who knows, just post what you think the forum needs! And lets see if anyone can help out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">06-12-2012, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love to see guides (not tutorials) on how to make money, best places to pg (manually) for each vocation from 1 - 200+, best places to bot from 1 - 200 for each vocation ;)<br />
<br />
If you make those guides I can help making tutorials or scripts ;)<br />
<br />
I ask for new guides because I feel the ones out there are outdated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">06-13-2012, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I would mainly like to see is now that this program is free why is there a cap of how many clients you can boot? Why am I having to run two seperate blackD's? I tried the fix to allow multiple clients editting a txt file but still does not work? Maybe I have done this incorrectly, but I did use the forum search and everybody else has had same problem? Can we atleast bump it to maybe 10 Max clients? 5 is a little low :P but I like the ideas of guides, im outdated myself but I can script! Gogo Blackd community. Nice to see everyone pitchin in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">06-13-2012, 22:38</div></div><div class="posttext">If changing the configs file (and remembering to save it!) doesn't work.. that is clearly a bug and needs to be forwarded to Daniel@blackdtools.net</div></div><hr />
