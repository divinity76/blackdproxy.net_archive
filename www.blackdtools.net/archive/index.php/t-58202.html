Has there been a lot of time in court? 
 
Uhmm, I just want to know everything and all the details about it what made it O.K to make these bots because I've seen in other games that people that tried to sell bots have been stuck in court battles for years and costing them insane money and sometimes they even lose the case." />

Creator(s) of WoW Glider for example were sued by Blizzard for this, among other reasons (read more here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDY_Indus._LLC_v._Blizzard_Entm%27t,_Inc.)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">06-05-2012, 20:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I think nobody really had any legal issue with Cipsoft. You see tons of OTs servers and tibia tools everywhere. No legal problems ever. This is Europe. Anyways I prefer to avoid risks, so I don't charge any money for my tools. They would not give big profit anyways so I give them for free to avoid some theoretically possible problems. I also warn everywhere that the user must accept the responsabilities and risk of the ban/deletion for using my tools.<br />
<br />
WoW - Blizzard - that is a different case: They have billions of dollars and they are registered in USA so they are powered by a lot of stupid laws that overprotect any big company registered in USA. Selling any bot in WoW is a direct suicide nowadays. That is sure.<br />
<br />
About Neobot: I think that the creator got scared when reading some new laws at Canada so he found a better job and closed the web. But I don't really know.</div></div><hr />
