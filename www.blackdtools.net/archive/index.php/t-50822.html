who all can delete threads? cuz its fucking suspicious that the sale-advertising thread of balru is deleted like it had never existed to apparently destroy any sort of proofs.</div></div><hr />

i dont see any point in postin the ss of the thread since all these people saw that malmis did post that the kid was 100% trusty, and obviously its gone now, balru used the email henke_90@live.se, and it said his name was henrik axelsson(from sweden). pretty suspicous right? and the 2 threads i posted here and on trade about it were deleted also, and if only blackd can change the passwords then must of been him, since ive had the same password for quite a while.. and dont think i would get it wrong 5 times in a row</div></div><hr />

yeah.. http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?t=50534<br />
<br />
its almost the same exact thing balru said and malmis confirms it saying the same exact thing<br />
<br />
, but when u go on malmis page it sais Last Activity: 03-22-2010 08:34 .but he posted that both balru and the other kid were 100% trusty neer the end of may, (5-22-2010)<br />
<br />
im willing to bed its just malmis using his &quot;power&quot; to scam people, like me since i thought u could trust someone like that...obviously not and its bullshit, and this is the truth since why would i have a reason to lie? i got fuckd over and just want other people to be more cautious, even of MODS</div></div><hr />

yeah thats what everyone was telling me that malmis is so trusty and highly respected. thats the only reason why i sent the kid money for the account.. i asked a lot of people believe me.. and everyone said the same thing that i wont get scammed if malmis confirms someone is trusty... yep.</div></div><hr />

is there any proof that the british queen actually is female? there's life beyond proves, imho. and in fact there is the proof that a mod used his granted powers to remove a thread without any specific reason.

if you know kanej then you must know balru since they were selling the same exact character (chosan) and malmis confirmed on both that they are 100% trusty and hes their rl friend, so u know him too? and everyone sais that he wouldnt do that and that they highly doubt he would ever, but look at me, he did, or someone he vouched for did. and thats not right for anyone to do let alone a MOD who is highly respected, i guess he thinks he will get away with it since nobody thinks he would do that, probably will if no one does anything about it, but razoor and satanas are investigating it..</div></div><hr />

<br />
@ lostrac, if that character (chosan) is your friend Kanej, how is it that the person &quot;balru&quot; was selling it and had the account. AND malmis confirmed that they were both his rl friends and 100% trusty, i have no reason to bull shit any of this, and i wouldnt bother going thru all this trouble if it didnt really happen.</div></div><hr />

then if its your friend who owns &quot;chosan&quot; tell him to give it to me cuz if its his account, then he was the one talking to me, since he went on and showed me it was is his</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way I can see it was posted is if I was hacked, because I, the real Malmis never took part in this shit.<br />
But I have no idea how that would off happened. Changed password now anyways. Blade has as he said contacted Daniel to see some logs and stuff, then we can see what happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@lexxis, yeah exactly all he did was confirm someone was trusty, dont u think he would go around scamming a lot more people then just one? coulda been done easily. could of pm'd a lot of people about their characters and told them to go first and get all their shit EASILY, since so many people trust him.<br />

and even IF (which is a long stretch) malmis was hacked and the guy was retarded enough to only try to scam one person by confirming they were trusty, i still get fucked out of this? BY TRUSTING A MOD? wow that seems fair as shit to me<br />

I know it's wierd, I think so to. I just changed the password to be extra safe, I'm still clueless as to what happened. But I am very sorry for what happened to you, but I assure you that I didn't do it. I hope to find out who did.</div></div><hr />

yeah assure me just like that guy said he assured me you wouldnt say that unless he was 100% trusty, so.. sorry, that means nothing to me, and so wtf does this mean, its over and im still fucked for trusting a mod? thats awesome..</div></div><hr />

If it really happend to a moderator, this one doesn't make all of them a thief.<br />

Oh, by the way, there is always the chargeback, even if it has a little delay, you can call the chargeback and get your money back. Just a tip.</div></div><hr />

yep so its all my fault.. ive never traded here before because i cant trust anyone, and the only reason i would is if i bought from a MOD, but i figured that one saying that they are 100% trustworthy, and is their rl friend, is practically the same, since they wouldnt put their rep on the line, and the person actually going on and showing me its his, he never acted like he was in a rush to sell it to me and to fuck me over, like.. im not a retard.. but the one time i do trade here for trusting someone i get fucked..600+ usd. thats how much. and i also only traded because i asked a lot of people about malmis and they told me if hes saying that, then they have to be trusty. &quot;oh id give malmis my char and not be worried&quot; and shit like that.. so yep my bad i must be a dumbass</div></div><hr />

I am waiting on my email back from blackd to see if he grants me special access to look into this matter further but as of right now there is no proof of anything that should strippin malmis of his postion.<br />
<br />
So far yes he said someone was trusty and you got scammed here are my questions on that (Do we know for a fact it was malmis? Do we have proof that malmis's account was or was not hacked? Even though the person that scammed you was swedish dose that automaticly make him malmis?)<br />
<br />
This matter is not over but until I recive an email from blackd nothing can be done esspecaily to malmis because thats not who the trade was conducted with</div></div><hr />

No offence but a Mod who's retarded enough to get hacked his account resulting in a guy losing 500 euros should defuckingfinetly lose his position just for idiocy's sake. It's Malmis responsibility after all to make sure his account data is safe. NO MATTER whether Malmis intentionally supported the scam or was hacked for real. Even tho I personally don't believe that guy a shit. If he had really been hacked, hacker could've ripped many more people off their cash. Why would he leave it at confirming just one guy trustworthy?</div></div><hr />

I stopped reading at the &quot;It is his responsibility to keep his account safe..&quot; part. There are many other ways to get your computer infected than just by downloading things. Who knows, he could have tried playing a java game, that had a drive-by on it and got infected. And actually, if you are at least somewhat bit computer literate, you would be able to find exploits in the forums and gain moderator/admin passwords. But you would also have to know how to crack salted md5 passwords. But I'm not going further into that subject.<br />
<br />
Maybe the hacker thought it would go unnoticed if he just confirmed one person trustworthy, or he didn't have anything else to &quot;sell&quot;, since the person who scammed the OP actually had access to a 294 EK.<br />
<br />
@OP<br />
The only way to check and see if Malmis @ the person selling the character have any relations would be to check and see if at least one of their IP's match. If that doesn't happen, then I doubt there is anything that can be done.<br />
<br />
Also, if you were dealing with such a large sum of money AND it was your first time trading, why not tell the kid to use Malmis as a middleman for the trade, so you could at least have his legit MSN, or have proof that he was involved in the trade. Even if you had been using any moderator as a middleman, at least some of your problems could have been avoided. <br />
<br />
Most scammers will tell you they don't want to use a middleman, or will try to use a fake msn to be a middleman. (another thing to watch for)</div></div><hr />

bullshit from first to last word. firstly, it's still due to his responsibility if he gets hacked and other injured by that, no fucking matter whether it was his fault or not that he got hacked. fault is not = responsibility. (u have ur blessed gun of doom which u've been granted for service for ur country stolen and someone uses its uber powers to shoot down coupla 5 years old and rob a bank, ur not responsible ?_?)and if it actually was that easy to hack everyone everywhere in every forum on the world, why is that malmis is the first mod here to get &quot;hacked&quot;.<br />
<br />
AND must be very big coincidence that malmis test out new java game and the scripter of the java game also plays tibia, has lvl 290 ek and wants to sell it on this forum. menz, world is small, no??</div></div><hr />

Nah, I doubt he got drive-by'd, That was just another example of getting hacked without downloading something.<br />
I'd say the easiest way to pwn most forums would be to access the mod cp, get the md5, desalt it,. etc, im not going into detail about that. Anywho, if you were to do that, you would have access to mod passwords.<br />
<br />
So they might have only had Malmis' password, or they had more and decided to only use one because it would look less fishy.</div></div><hr />

But some mod backed him up and my friend couldnt do shit. It really suprises me to still hear about Kanej..

<br />
Hmmm..<br />
<br />
I've always been reading the forums even though I'm inactive. I just don't feel like posting. Might happen to him aswell, and I'm pretty sure someone warned him in any kind of messenger about what happened, thus making him feel like defending himself. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I wonder why the guy who supposely got robbed by Malmis hasn't asked paypal for a chargeback.<br />
<br />
I guess 500+ USD is worth at least a phone call to try and solve it (and I mean, calling paypal - if there is any number).<br />
<br />
I would do it even for less...</div></div><hr />

Kinda funny how you say why dont we check ips well my friend i have been befor you even made that comment...<br />
<br />
<br />
So far i have found Some ip matches But they all lead to proxys execpt for one that leads to a webserver with FTP properties Which im wondering if it is not a tusnami overhost server that malmis got infect with and in which his account got hacked......<br />
<br />
But as of right now without blackd responding to me i cant check the things i need to check....<br />
<br />
I do belive something fishy is going on but i do not know what it is.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if malmis is in it on purpos or not but if blackd would reply to me i would know more of what i need for the investigation and dont worrie i havent forgotten about this matter its just not much i can do unless blackd responds back to me.....<br />
<br />
Im sorry im really trying to close up this investigation........... there is nothing i can do at the moment though until blackd dose something for me......</div></div><hr />

Are you serious? blade has mentioned atleast 5 times that we have no proof to go on. So we should ban every mod and every user we think might be a scammer?</div></div><hr />

Did i ever say that? no. What i said is that we not got enought proof to give out any punshiment. We are still waiting for Blackd to respond to Blade's email so he can get more research on the whole thing. Only thing we know so far is that the ip match malmis got with Balru is a proxy ip (Hidemyass.com) wish a few other members also matched with as they have used the same site to hide their ips when logging on to the forum for some reason. And as blade mentioned one of balrus ips leads to a webserver with FTP properties, and he also mentions that it could be a tusnami overhost server that malmis got infect with.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AnnoyedCustomer</div><div class="date">07-13-2010, 16:10</div></div><div class="posttext">lets just have a clear summary of the facts and just the facts.<br />
<br />
1. guy advertises to sell 290 ek.<br />
2. malmis posts he is trustworthy<br />
3. guy scams as a result of that a guy for 500+ euros (which he luckily managed to get back now)<br />
4. malmis (who else couldve been it?) deletes the thread where he stated the scammer was trustworthy.<br />
 AND THIS IMHO PROVES IT WAS THE REAL MALMIS, WHAT HACKER WOULD CARE ABOUT DESTROYING THE REP OF A HACKED MOD ACCOUNT THAT WILL BE RECOVERED SOONER OR LATER ANYWAY AND THAT HE ONLY HACKED FOR THE PURPOSE OF SELLING THIS ONE CHAR AND THATS WHAT HE IS SUPOSED TO HAVE DONE INNIT? CUZ HE DIDNT TRY ANY OTHER SCAMS. that guys is simply logic.<br />
<br />
I haven't been hacked A SINGLE FUCKING TIME IN 8 YEARS OF PLAYING TIBIA AND BROWSING THE NET and now Malmis gets hacked just at the right time a guy wants to sell his 290 ek and this hacker by pure coincidence is the seller himself or a friend of him and helps him with the scam and just this one scam and not 20 more scams? I BEG YOU, I HONESTLY BEG YOU. This is all so hilarious, it hurts to watch it. <br />
<br />
My opinion: Malmis tried to make his long-built-reputation for 500 euros, and I can understand that very well. No fucking forum moderatorship on earth is worth more than 500 easily-gained euros. So all this trustworthybullshit can be shoved up an ass that cares because everyone who sits and tries to think straight for a minute would realize that Malmis just did a choice nearly everyone else would've taken as well. He certainly right now laughes his ass irl that he apparently even gets away with it.</div></div><hr />

What you say makes sense but still, do you think malmis would make a 500 euros scam by paypal after being a mod on this forum for so long and seen about all charge backs thats been done? that in the other hand doesn't make sense to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I find really mean, is that mods try to protect other mods, but they find it easy to point fingers and call suspects from the other normal posters like us.<br />
<br />
PD: Yeah, Ive found people isnt ready to trade with me since that post that said I was the scammer, even with people that trusted me before... It kinda fucked over the little reputation I had...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KILLCREW3</div><div class="date">07-13-2010, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">im glad atleast a couple people have been following this besides mods because what annoyedcustomer said is what ive pretty much been saying the whole time, and like he said, it makes perfect sence that it was actually malmis, and he didnt get hacked, the way they went about the scam made it pretty clear (deleting the threads, only 1 scam, would work because of high rep) and someone hacking a mod account knowing to go to this site and just happen to want to &quot;sell&quot; a 294 ek. i fully agree with annoyedcustomer, he knows how to think about it in a practacle way</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, malmis has been mod on this forum for i believe 2 years now. during the last year he basically hasn't been active at all. so it's fully logical for him to make 500 euro off a forum he has no interest in anymore. there is nothing about this case that doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
that being said, malmis used to be a friend of mine and our &quot;friendship&quot; just kind of faded with inactivity. i'm not going to say some cliche about how i can't imagine him doing this, because not doing this is what wouldn't make sense. it all depends on where your priorities are, and what you care about. and in malmis' case, i have no idea as we haven't spoken in well over 2 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KILLCREW3</div><div class="date">07-13-2010, 22:56</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, and wierd blackd doesnt respond to blade for over a month about his mods scamming but he responds to peoples email that buy gold from him, strange</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyax</div><div class="date">07-15-2010, 08:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed blackd dont care about this forum anymore. Only his &quot;gold&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blink182</div><div class="date">07-21-2010, 10:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess who's back?!?! Just for today though. I was tryign to reach someone but i failed doing so. However this thread looked funny so i read all the pages. <br />
I have realized this so far:<br />
<br />
<br />
Buyer of the character is kinda stupid. I cant imagine how anyone would send someone 630$ bucks without having his phone number, address. I would even ask for ID. We are not talking about 30 bucks. Another thing why didnt you make you sure you could chargeback if this went wrong.<br />
<br />
Mod who vouched for the guy. Well after reading the posts of the people who said that saw your reply on that guys post, if you got actually hacked, teh hacker must be retarded. I mean if i was a thief and i had a moderators account teh first thing i would do is,  try to make my own trades and scam people. I wouldnt even bother on vouching for someone or bla bla. Maybe you did vouche for that person, because you thought he was legit. But then you saw, he scammd the other guy, and you realized you were in big trouble. That could have happened, thats why people shouldnt buy for anyone unless they are RLS.  They also say you deleted that guys thread, well as far as i know users can delete their own threads, so you were not the only one who could have deleted &quot;balrus&quot; thread, because he could have done it himself.<br />
<br />
Well thats it and i guess i will be gone for a while again!<br />
<br />
See you all someday!</div></div><hr />

If Blackd thinks I'm involved I will step down from Super Moderator volountarily, even tough I had nothing to do with this.<br />
I'm sorry that you some of you think we moderators just protect eachother's backs and even more sorry old friends think I would do this.<br />
Even though I'm retired I'm proud of being a moderator here, and would not jeopardize by participating in a scam, not even for $600.<br />
<br />
This is the last from me on this subject, now it's up to whatever Blade and others can find and what BlackD thinks about this.</div></div><hr />
