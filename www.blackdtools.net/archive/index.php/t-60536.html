Is it safe, if I use BlackD Proxy 29.2 (for client 10.01) on Tibia client 10.02? 
 
It works though, I guess they only patched things that were announced on tibia.com and since I don't take part in any of those things I presume using runemaker section and healing section is safe? 
 
Well either way, I'm looking forward to BlackD Proxy 29.3 soon! ^_^ 
 
Take care!" />

Are you playing some kind of test server?<br />
<br />
Anyways if Blackd Proxy still works there then I guess they changed nothing important, so it should be as safe (or unsafe) as always. You still should use it only at your own resposability, as always.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you can still log in with Tibia client 10.01 even though they've patched it to 10.02 due to a bug regarding PVP they said. Client doesn't automatically update like it used to in the past.<br />
<br />
Anyway, link to their download page: https://secure.tibia.com/account/?subtopic=downloadclient<br />
<br />
I'm only using Cavebot section at the moment ... I'm fishing that is! ^^</div></div><hr />
