He opened a dispute in Paypal Costumer Support (or something like that) . When I saw it I put evidences with screen on messenger &amp; his emails adressed to me . <br />
It lasted for about 1 week and I won first case.<br />
He opened a new dispute. Same story, I gave to Paypal guys a proofs and won!.<br />
<br />
So if you are going to sell cash through paypal you should  protect yourself with some evidence.</div></div><hr />
