NOTE for a more balanced Ethania:<br />
- In this new edition a lot of stuffs has been changed! We have made some small changes on the donation items. We have made some decreases on the protection of some items so they won't be seen as an OVERPOWERED donation item. The items are still great and looking even better now then before! This will make also the server a bit more balanced in fights. So there won't be to OP players running on the field!<br />
<br />
- In this edtion if you got red cross / white skull you will have an exhaust of making waves and UE spells and the AOE spells and runes as avalanche rune and waves will make lower damage. <br />
More additional information about this edition will be given later! Stay tuned!<br />
