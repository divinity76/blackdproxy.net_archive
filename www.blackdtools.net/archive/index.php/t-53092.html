<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">10-28-2010, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of games use these things.<br />
You might want to say that Tibia isn't original but I can't see the point if you're meaning that is going to be bad.<br />
The new version isn't yet released, as themselves said, there's no date yet...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Satanás</div><div class="date">10-28-2010, 20:51</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just saying their not original anymore.<br />
<br />
And I just want a nice collection of things the german copied, would be nice to know how many things they ripped off from most successful games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">10-28-2010, 20:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Tibia have been out for alot longer that wow, and I think wow is pretty much alike tibia.<br />
<br />
I don't understand your point either. I like this progress in this flash client. Waiting for it &lt;3</div></div><hr />

It is bad, I play tibia for a reason - its not wow, i hate wow :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's my point:<br />
&quot;WORLD OF WARCRAFT® SUBSCRIBER BASE REACHES 12 MILLION WORLDWIDE&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The maximum on all game worlds together was 64028 players on Nov 28 2007, 19:26:00 CET.&quot; - And it was because of the 2x EXP week.<br />
<br />
So they are losing originality just because their profit went bad by banning botters.<br />
<br />
Good luck, but mind that on the future you'll be paying for a 2D wow where they can ban you for saying &quot;black&quot; on the default channel, close-minded fanboy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Webber</div><div class="date">10-29-2010, 07:56</div></div><div class="posttext">there is some new functions that are coming i agree with that others dont for some stupid reasons, example fast switch for armor/arrows, i think this has been needed for years, but why do people go against it? so many people are against any change cip comes out with, although i do believe its getting to the point where the new features need to be put on hold and they fix the client bugs, finish quest and balance the vocations (wich they just cant seem to get right)</div></div><hr />
