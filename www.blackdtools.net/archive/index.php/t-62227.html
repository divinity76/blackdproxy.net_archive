<br />
switch to an non-retarded antivirus software, and try again. (or alternatively, contact your antivirus support, and teach them about this false positive in blackd classic, and wait for an updated version of your antivirus ...good luck - last i tried this with Avira / Avast , it turned out that the customer support were retarded and inststed that it was malicious - even when i showed them the source code, but they refused to even say why they believed it to be malicious --- fucking retards)</div></div><hr />
