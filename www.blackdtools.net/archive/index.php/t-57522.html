	<meta name="description" content="When using setFollow with setChaoticMovesON the follow of the bot just does not work at all. Runs circles around monsters. I'm not alone in this. I guess this is because both the move commands and the commands used by the bot to reach monsters uses the same function, with same random movement. 
 
If that is NOT the exact reason why it's not working then just please make the cavebot usable again I'm seriously getting tired of dying and seeing the bot not loot rares. 
 
Please fix this ASAP!" />

It does not protect you from ban and it only causes a lot of problem so I think it is better to leave it disabled. I probably will leave it completely disabled and unsupported in next version.</div></div><hr />
