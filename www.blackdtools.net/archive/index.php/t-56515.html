Yeah, I was going to purchase it but as I'm away from home to study I cannot get my paypal vertified. Which kinda suxs. My bank is a local one and from what I understand to vertify my paypal I have to go talk to them?</div></div><hr />

If any other mod want a free license please just contact me by email. It is no problem for me.<br />
<br />
The only licenses I can't register for free are the WoW bot licenses.</div></div><hr />

ok, Blade won. I sent you an email message requesting your char name so I send the gold there. Please reply to it quoting that email message.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice this forum didn't allow to attach .cam files. Good trick using a zip file. Anyways I have modified the forum so it will allow to attach .cam files from now.</div></div><hr />
