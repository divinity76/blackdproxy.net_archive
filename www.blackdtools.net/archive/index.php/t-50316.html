dude at lvl 20 i was making like 60k/h with a blocker on eart elementals at edron<br />
after that got a blocker for dls at like lvl 40 and was getting 130k/h (was paying the blocker and used many supplies)<br />
i got like lvl 1-60 in like 1 week and wasted like 1.5-2kk<br />
wouldnt recomend it... just level normally till lvl 50-70, then you go PG to dls solo and you will not waste as much and get very VERY fast levels<br />
just my opinion</div></div><hr />

lol what a waste of money...<br />
at 30 go ancient scarabs solo lure one by one and you will get around 70k/h til 45 and than go sd dls solo with fire set...</div></div><hr />

like i told you i would rather hunt with a blocker and pay him off better than solo<br />
<br />
