	<meta name="description" content="Hey dear Daniel, 
If you are still into programming and you want to still earn money by making bots, then I have a suggestion to you. 
There is new tactical mmorpg called Wakfu (based on old Dofus mmorpg) and there is no any game guard, detection system or anything - only gamemasters !! 
 
There is also not a big bot community as there is no international bots - only french peoples make bots in french languages, and they made it for dofus - wakfu is like week after release so there is still" />

<br />
Please take a look on it as international community would need the bot and you may be somehow back into the buisness ;)<br />
<br />
of course I believe that making bot for turn based fight system may be hard, there is a lot of proffesion and it is really boring as hell to level them.<br />
<br />
If you are interested, send me PM so I can even buy you premium for wakfu so you can take a look into this game</div></div><hr />

Well nevermind then tho it is really nice way to gain money as game is 2D and it shoudln't be hard to develop a bot for someone like Daniel</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-07-2012, 20:45</div></div><div class="posttext">developing a new bot is almost as hard as developing a new game. I can only try to fix my current bots, but I have no time for much more.<br />
Btw, today I updated many things in Blackd Proxy and I made a new -hopefully better- installer. I am also waiting an answer from Hans as I lost last code he sent me and I need that he resend me all that. I will try to add all his code as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />
