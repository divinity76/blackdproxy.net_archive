Im retired since 2008, and comming back to play this week. 
I saw that cip had developed some system that identify automatically who is using some kind of bot, and is banning everyone. 
But, at the same time im seeing that many ppl are using it =S 
i would like to know if this system is true. 
I dont want to cave bot, or something like that. i wold like to use bot just to heal my char, put loot in bag, etc. 
Do i take any risk doing that? which safer bot should i use?

<br />
BlackD currently has a safebot seperate to the old Proxy you may remember.<br />
<br />
This can heal you, although I am unsure of other features as I am only a BlackDproxy user.<br />
<br />
You'll probably get alot of replies about things such as &quot;neobot&quot; &quot;elfbot&quot; &quot;ghostbot&quot; and them all being safe, but I cannot say they are myself.</div></div><hr />

BlackD/elfbot/ Tibia auto/ NG, etc. are all 100% detectable and will get u banned.<br />
<br />
however, The Ngsoft staff released &quot;ghostbot&quot; which it is apparently safe (includes healer, light, etc).<br />
<br />
And the old programmer of elfbot created &quot;neobot&quot; which is apparently undetectable and provides things like cavebot, targeting, healing, etc.<br />
<br />
And Daniel released Blackd safe cheats which it is also considered safe. (almost same functions as neobot)<br />
<br />

I think Blackd Proxy is almost undetectable now (but I won't guarantee it yet). There are still a few things that might be detectable, but they are hard to &quot;fix&quot; For example:<br />
- using scripts that send outdated packets through exiva &gt;<br />
- trying to login after an update without having updated Blackd Proxy<br />
 <br />
I even might start botting again O.o</div></div><hr />

It ,bans' (nobody see results) about 5000 players/month. The safest bots at the moment are Blackd Safe Cheats and Neobot. If you want to know more - CIPSOFT already improved Tibia by adding for example stacking gold, so you don't even need to use bot :p.</div></div><hr />
