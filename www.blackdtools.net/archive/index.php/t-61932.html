The 7.4 Server<br />
<br />
About Tibianic<br />
Tibianic started off as a students project back in 2009 with only thirty players online on average (everything 2x rate). Today we established an online community of more than 1.000 active players and with peaks of 450 players online at once.<br />
Tibianic is a game which gives a possiblity to the player to take a journey into the wonderful lands of our mysterious fantasy world, full of magic and beauty.<br />
The player is allowed to choose one of four vocations during the journey on Tibianic, unique classes which require different playing skills. The beauty of Tibianic lays within in it's interactive community, the old-school pixel-art and the challenging game-play. The game enables the player to roam infinitely long across the plains together with their friends. Exploring, interacting in guilds, participating in conflicts, team hunts, questing and designing your own house are just a few features of Tibianic which are different to other games as the individual skill of the player, the personal game-play, impacts these features such as the profitability of a hunt, the outcome of a quest and the hierarchic standing of the player within the community. This Server is already On-line for about 3 years, WITHOUT reset <br />
