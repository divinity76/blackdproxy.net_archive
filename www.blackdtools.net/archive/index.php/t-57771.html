None of my accounts have been banned, even the knight that has been on for 23 hours at a time on some days. Perhaps you have been using other software as well?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We constantly remind players not to use blackdproxy cavebot on premium accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kexxet</div><div class="date">04-12-2012, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">I had MC, also tibia auto and xenobot installed on my comp but used it once on another char(also banned).<br />
i talked a little about bots and so on with friends in-game <br />
i also used to stay online from stamina:42-14</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">04-12-2012, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Safe on all accounts, in last couple of months I've been botting 10 accounts with over 20 characters all together.<br />
<br />
Stuff I used:<br />
1.) Runemaker = lol, just auto eating food here<br />
2.) Conditional Events = ifmymana ~ blablabla ... mana burning<br />
3.) Trainer: 'dance' at 15 min marker<br />
4.) Cavebot: really simple scripts with no fancy depositer or potion buyer or whatever, looked like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
setMeleeKill<br />
SetLoot<br />
move x,y,z<br />
gotoscriptline 0<br />
<br />
Sometimes I set lootOff so I can be sure I didn't look suspicious to the 'anti-bot tool'.<br />
<br />
I still haven't checked all my accounts, I've checked only the 'main' ones which would suck dick if they were deleted.<br />
<br />
I dunno people, like @BlackD said many times and also other trustable members of BlackD community, do not use cavebot on main accounts ... I did, I guess I was just lucky. :)</div></div><hr />

I think blackd is pretty safe then... because my friend had blackd and tibia auto and he is not banned..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">austinjt</div><div class="date">04-13-2012, 07:34</div></div><div class="posttext">lost a level 39 knight no biggie i used only blackd and tibia auto on my chars only reason he got deleted is cause i ran stamina 8 hours low 1 day<br />
so now im just going to alternate chars ever 3 hours max<br />
then i can be safe if you run stamina past -6 your instantly going to get deleted<br />
pretty much so be safe</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
Tibia Auto and some features in Blackd Proxy are known to be detectable, the stamina thing is a misconception as I've had characters with 0:0 stamina training in a facc hunting place. I would suggest you to use safer features/bots<br />
<br />
Edit: Perhaps more convincing, me and 2-3 friends more (Even using different software) are doing it.<br />

I've been doing this as well so maybe this makes it easier to understand what the system is detecting to ban/delete the accounts</div></div><hr />

safe.<br />
Remember guys if you bot more than 15h it's easy to get ban!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The report system has 0% point. You can report the same botter over 9000!!! times and still nothing.<br />
<br />
Then an unreported botter can get caught.</div></div><hr />
