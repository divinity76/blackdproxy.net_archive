<br />
Ok, Firstly check the box in the red square.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://i14.tinypic.com/446aut3.jpg<br />
(http://i14.tinypic.com/446aut3.jpg if you can't see pic)<br />
<br />
Ok now make sure you have no accounts connected and log in using your acc/password (easiest to do these one by one) Take them with whatever supplies you need etc (sd's duh) and log them out in the EXACT square you want them. Once you got all those done it's best you turn the option in the red square off.<br />
<br />
http://i13.tinypic.com/2d8jig5.jpg<br />
(http://i13.tinypic.com/2d8jig5.jpg if you can't see pic)<br />
<br />
So now you have all your bombers logged out where you want them etc, Now is to set up the word part of the bomb. Write your targets name in the red rectangled area, Then choose the MS you want your bombers to keep trying to SD the target in the purple area (so if you wanted them to try sd for 10 seconds you would have 10000).<br />
<br />
http://i13.tinypic.com/30wkok3.jpg<br />
(http://i13.tinypic.com/30wkok3.jpg if you can't see pic)<br />
<br />
Ok now, Press the reload button (loads up all the chars) and then select from the drop down menu(blue rectangle) a character you want in the bomber squad and click the yellow rectangled button. This adds the character to the bomber squad list(where i've written bomber one, two, three)<br />
<br />
After this you are READY get on another char and wait/lure the target to your bomber zone when ready 'Exiva bomb' And watch the bastard die with huge success.<br />
<br />
If your planning this ahead of time (maybe a week or so in advance) then you can use the save button so you can reload the bombers you want the target you want and shoot without having to redo it everytime you start blackd.<br />
(probably best to use specific names to save name as aka killtom.txt Dragoondead.txt)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps, I have NOT tested on real targets YET so these may be wrong but my knowledge of things believes me to think this is right. Have fun bombing. Blackd correct things if they need to be.<br />
<br />
PS. If anyone has a free acc mage inferna level 18+ and doesn't want it feel free to PM the acc/pass (was worth a try :p)<br />
<br />
PLEASE POST IF YOU NEED HELP.<br />

 <br />
Anyways I will give an alternative way, maybe faster: <br />
 <br />
step 1. enable the loger checkbox<br />
step 2: login all your magebombs characters<br />
step 3: (optionally) disable the loger checkbox<br />
step 4: press the yellow &quot;&lt;-Reload&quot; button<br />
step 5: load all your logs to a magebomb list (setting attack mode, target and time retry for each)<br />
step 6: (optionally) save your magebomb list for future fast loading of it.<br />
step 7: go with scout to the place where all the magegombs are loged out and when enemy(s) comes do: exiva bomb</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-29-2006, 17:23</div></div><div class="posttext">it is totally blind clientless. The magebombs extract the required info to shoot from the scout &quot;eyes&quot;. That is why it is recommended to have the scout near the enemy when you do exiva bomb<br />
 <br />
In 9.00 it would crash if the scout was not near the enemys.<br />
In 9.01 it will just reject to shoot if the scout doesn't have enough info for the attack*<br />
 <br />
 <br />
* As the magebomb only needs the ID of the enemies to build the attack packet, I have modified it so it would be enough to see your enemy once with that scout and then you can shot it anywhere, anytime, unless you or the enemy logout (in such cases the ID info would be lost) Optionally you can add your enemies to your VIP and then blackd proxy will ALWAYS know the IDs of your enemies, so you would not even need to see them to activate the magebomb from any point of tibia, any time.</div></div><hr />

Fass, make sure there aren't any spaces between the &quot;:&quot; and the beginning of the target, I'll use the combo for an example, it should be &quot;fireSDnow:InsertTargetName&quot; not &quot;fireSDnow: WrongWayOfInsertion&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Tom, about that Inferna thingy, I'm trying to start a mage-bomb project there, altho, I'm a bit short of people, we're also going to do normal combos, If there's any interest out there, just PM me, and I'm from Sweden (if it makes any difference...) ^^</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The shots are done by ID using the new tibia &quot;hotkey'ed shot&quot; feature that allows magebomb to shot without opening any bacpack, from the very first moment they login. That feature didn't exist in 7.6<br />
 <br />
I guess this is the case, as already said,  &quot;gangsta pally&quot; does not exist on real servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot; Ok now make sure you have no accounts connected and log in using your acc/password (easiest to do these one by one) Take them with whatever supplies you need etc (sd's duh) and log them out in the EXACT square you want them. Once you got all those done it's best you turn the option in the red square off.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
can someone explain it a little better?<br />
<br />
cya</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Webber</div><div class="date">10-30-2006, 04:35</div></div><div class="posttext">do not have any acc logged in now check that box to create log files...<br />

now complete a full login, choose the charecter place, place him and logout... do that with all accounts, give him sd's or hmms (lol hmms) after all are placed etc, uncheck the box</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont understand part of tutorial<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to run like 20 MCs for 20 bombers ? or only 1 tibia window ?<br />
<br />
<br />
btw :D can someone make *.wav movie with tutorial for it ? xD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luddizz</div><div class="date">10-30-2006, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">rofl at the .wav tutorial, but no, you dont need 20 clients, you only need one client to make this, you dont even need to have MC :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kjeld</div><div class="date">10-30-2006, 18:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to have 20 tibia windows open.<br />
<br />
Als you do is, open one client:<br />
<br />
Login on the desired characters (While log box is ticked) set them in position.<br />
<br />
If you placed all the characters right, tick the box again so it will be unticked.<br />
<br />
Then follow the next steps of the tutorial!<br />
<br />
When you appointed a targed e.a: Kjeld<br />
<br />
Then you should have a list with with bombmages.<br />
<br />
it should look like this:<br />
<br />
Bomber 1               5                Kjeld                5000<br />
Bomber 2               5                Kjeld                5000<br />
Bomber 3               5                Kjeld                5000<br />
<br />
Then login on a &quot;scout&quot; character, lure the enemy,(in this case, it is Kjeld) to the place where the bombers are logged out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lure him, and when you are in place, type in the default channel the magic words: &quot;exiva bomb&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then you should get ready.... And &lt;poof&gt; they all login and blast their sds on the targed &quot;Kjeld&quot;.<br />
<br />
note: Make sure they wear SDs ( or any other runes, its up to you what runes you are using.)<br />
<br />
Kjeld~</div></div><hr />

Buy blackdtool proxy, sending blackd via msn(wich contains magebomb) will never be possible because you need your account pw and name and if you are using blackd then you should read the tutorial good</div></div><hr />

That's because magebomb doesn't work on 7.92 since it can't attack during the 10 first seconds when you login.</div></div><hr />

<br />
exiva mcit exiva +0TARGETNAME<br />
<br />
this makes all ur mc char say &quot;exiva +0TARGETNAME&quot; which will make ur char cast 1 Sd onto the target name (must change TARGETNAME to who u want to kill so like eg exiva +0Setzer Gambler or whatever) this should work.<br />
<br />
just make sure the chars are previously logged on it wont work if u try to use the magebomb (because of 10 seconds waiting)</div></div><hr />

Using other runes:<br />
<br />
Change IDs in Configs for a rune you can use to the rune you want.<br />
<br />
Magebomb doesn't use Clients. So NO MULTI CLIENTS NEED TO BE OPEN<br />
<br />
For all the login problems, you must disable antiban mode because it uses bypass login severs. And for OTs if it doesn't work its probably a problem with the OT and blackD is made generally for real tibia.<br />

I've heard some people say that I should edit the config, but some people say that it doesn't affect the Magebomb. Just all commands and such.<br />

Just go into the configs and change the ID for explotion (or w/e) for the ID for LMM/Icicle w/e and select in magebomb &quot;Shoot Explotion&quot;</div></div><hr />

I supose you want to change target of magebomb after they log in? <br />
Yes it is possible, just write &quot;exiva magebomb playername&quot;and your team will atack.<br />
@Martin<br />
You have to give him your pass to your characters, or he to you. If you and he have blackd you can use and communicator like team speak, ventrilo or just chat in tibia to synchronize your attacks</div></div><hr />

Well, when they did mass deletions of bomb characters they just deleted every account involved unless it had a high level on it, then it got 30 days for using unoffical software to play</div></div><hr />

Some OTs do not support it... You will also have to try disabling anti ban mode and making sure the SD is the correct ID etc etc</div></div><hr />
