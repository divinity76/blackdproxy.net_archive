	<meta name="description" content="Hello! 
My proposal is that add the new command exiva for example I want to add new ding so I add to new folder in Blackd &quot;Alarms&quot; and use it by command exiva sound loot.wav. Of course it was example, it should be another folder and another sound. 
What do you think about it? I and probably many people would have it. 
 
Sorry for errors, but my english level is low." />
