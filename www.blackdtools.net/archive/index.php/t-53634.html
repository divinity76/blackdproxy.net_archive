Proposal:<br />
<br />
What i am proposing here is, according to the number posts that an account has, their title could be automatically changed to something more worshipful. After all, those are the ones who strives for this.<br />
So please, post what do you think about here and propose some numbers with a possible title.<br />
I will update the main thread with the proposed ideas and, in the end, we will vote for them :D<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
[0 , 50] posts -----&gt;Newcomer<br />
[51 , 200] months------&gt;Member<br />

There is no proposal board related to the forum. So the only place i thought was wise to put is here.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I think titles based on post count will lead to alot of people spamming.<br />
Will only leading to spamming if they post non-sense things. However those will be punished for it.<br />
<br />
The proposal can be changed for days, weeks or even years instead of post count. We are here to discuss the best way how could this be implemented, turning it more creative and fun for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Peoples already spams for post count, titles will only be a new reason for them. And ofc they would be punished but its still stupid to give peoples a new reason to spam for. Now this forum is pretty much only used as a big trade board so as long as nothing big happends that will change that, new titles wont be needed. thats just how i see it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-14-2010, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">So you guys rather have them based on time, instead of post counts?<br />
<br />
We need to take attention to what vantages or disadvantages one or another brings:<br />
<br />
 If we had it based on post count, the forum could be more active. Number of active thread will increase and if the information is good, the number of active members might increase. Meanwhile we would have to deal with bigger rates of spam.<br />
 If we had it based on time, we would incentive users to post, only to post, in order to get titles. Time based means that someone enjoys the community and has some faith on it.<br />
<br />
This is just my point of view. At this point, my vote goes to time based titles.</div></div><hr />

Well if it only was as easy as you makes it sound to make the forum active again.. The real deal is that the forum is dead becuse its a bot forum of a bot thats not safe so the members we got is mostly oldschoolers and peoples selling and trading. Until blackd do something with the bot i'm pretty sure the rate of members/activity wont increase to much, not even with new titles.:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">12-15-2010, 05:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm this idea could be taken but in my eyes what would be great is some function like the Like on facebook.<br />
People would &quot;like&quot; a thread or a post and maybe a &quot;dislike&quot; so it could be removed or not seen (as youtube comments).<br />
<br />
Anyway, just an idea.</div></div><hr />
