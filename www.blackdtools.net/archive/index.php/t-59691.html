<br />
Which I know it isn't because the first client logged on flawlessly, sit tight for another update folks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">11-08-2012, 23:08</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry, it was a bug caused by the new character list format. I am fixing it in 26.0. <br />
Uploading it... give me 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">11-08-2012, 23:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeup! Works great, thanks again Daniel for the timely update ! Everyone remember to go back and re-download 26.0 to fix the MC issue with the new character screen!<br />
<br />
Quick Edit; Seems now with the new char screen it also has made the conditionals and runemaker not be able to view the proper character name it justs titles them all as #1. Take a break D, work on it some more when ya got some free time.<br />
