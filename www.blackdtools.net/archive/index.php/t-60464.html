<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Afwasmidd</div><div class="date">06-07-2013, 01:47</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently made a script that hunts for Trolls and Rotworms in Edron. You can find it here (http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?60392-Afwasmiddel-s-Edron-Rotworms-bot-for-Paladins). I made it for my low level paladin. It replenishes spears and potions by itself. It will start with around 4k exp/hour and ends with around 12k exp/hour (if you are alone in the caves). Just makes sure your backpack is open and that you carry a shovel and a rope with you. <br />
Please note that all scripts stopped working at the moment because of the recent Tibia patch. So you can't use any scripts yet.</div></div><hr />
