<br />
i've read through MANY programming ebooks and know all the basics and all ifs, loops, arrays and that shit. When i open up the IDE and try to code something (even when i had clear idea what i want to do) i dunno what to write there. It's like i dont know the keywords.. just like in e.g. HTML you just gotta memorize the tagnames, does it work the same way in programming languages? :confused:</div></div><hr />
