And from what it seems of both TibiaBot NG forums and Blackd forums Elf Bot appears to be one of if not the safest bots out there. Perhaps that is why the price is so steep, though it's capabilities are pretty advanced.</div></div><hr />

New ban today shows all the BlackD users who swapped to Elfbot still got banned.<br />
<br />
Conclusion, elfbot community sucks, BlackD community rocks :P<br />
<br />
P.S I remain unbanned again using BlackD</div></div><hr />

In terms of community without a doubt BlackD is the best, but that relates nothing towards the topic. And I'm not saying ElfBot is safe, by all means no bot is safe but just from hear say and from many people's comments I have noticed far less people being banned elfbot than any other program :/. But as I said this is just somthing I have noticed personally.</div></div><hr />

On this computer (work computer :P) I use blackd ALL DAY every day (Cept when low stam) and somehow I have not been banned. <br />
<br />
I actually planned on getting banned thats why I botted to the extreme to just make shit loads of cash then take it off the account post ban..but im still botting...Sofar blackd is the way to go (Except noone releases new scripts EVER :()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stefan50</div><div class="date">04-11-2010, 21:23</div></div><div class="posttext">all bots are equal in getting detected since i got banned in blackd and ng and elfbot so i don't think that realy matters but i think elfbot is still the best since it is the most advanced bot.</div></div><hr />
