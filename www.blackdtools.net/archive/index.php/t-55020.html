<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-13-2011, 11:13</div></div><div class="posttext">- First of all, your social security number is not your national identification number. I don't need your social security number! What I request is the code displayed at your main photo id card, nothing else.<br />
- All the legal webs are forced to ask some basic information in order to generate an invoice. I don't need that for anything else. If you don't care about having a correct invoice then write anything there. I don't care. <br />
- I won't share that information with anyone.<br />
- We have a securre HTTPS connection: https://blackdtools.net/tibiagold.php . We have a valid certificate.<br />
- If you still will not buy gold then please go to do trolling somewhere else. Your post count of 1 yells &quot;I only came here to write something against this shop&quot;</div></div><hr />
