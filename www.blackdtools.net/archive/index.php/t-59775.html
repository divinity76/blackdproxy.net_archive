And making sure this is all done safely like not trying to cut already cut grass, digging holes that have already been dug ect....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-07-2012, 04:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, hopefully this helps I have a moment to briefly explain,<br />
<br />
1. Record way point directly on rope hole, and then record the exact waypoint you land on way up.<br />
ex; move xxxxx,xxxxx,6<br />
     move xxxxx,xxxxx,7<br />
2. No need to tell the bot, same idea as rope hole but backwards. Record way point directly ADJACENT to shovel hole second waypoint is recorded exactly where you fall on the floor underneath the loose stone pile.<br />
ex ; move xxxxx,xxxxx,7<br />
      move xxxxx,xxxxx,6<br />
3. Cutting the grass is possible but requires you to check packets of the square you are cutting, if you are not an advanced scripter I do not suggest attempting this before reading or being shown a tutorial on how to do so.<br />
4. Same as question 3, doors are a packet you have to send, this being said that requires you to update your scripts constantly and also the chance of being &quot;auto-detected&quot; and permanently banned.<br />
5. Yes, the trick I like to use is cram your main bp with about 3-4 additional backpacks, open them up but close them to as small as they will go ( 1 square of length, 4 squares of width ) Leave enough room that when you kill and loot a monster he is still able to open a body/bag/bp/depot without it closing another pack, still need atleast some looting room.<br />
<br />
The problem with grass like I said may happen cause that is a packet, but the shovel holes you should not have to worry about, the bot will auto-dig and jump through if you write it as I explained. I still haven't figured out how it auto organizes loot but if you just open a bunch of bps and then goto banker and &quot;deposit all&quot; you will be left with only monster loot to sort from which makes life a ton easier. Hope this helped in anyway, and good luck using BlackD.<br />
<br />
Note; I have a botting project going on in the screenshots/videos/botting forum if you are interested and have any further questions I might be able to help.<br />

Doesn't have to be exact. But no harm in doing so<br />

You can also minimise the backpacks and the bot will still fill them</div></div><hr />
