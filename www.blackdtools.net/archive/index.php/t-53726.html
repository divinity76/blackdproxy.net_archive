So everything was going as usuall using the magebomb, Untill my target showed up. I wrote the magic words and the magebomb characters logged in. <br />
As i watched my characters just stand there, doing absolutley nothing for about 15 seconds, The guy in question paniced and hit &quot;UE&quot; Which caused him to get banned from the server(WIN!:cool:). <br />
<br />
However i started to investigate as to why the magebomb didnt fire.<br />
<br />
I took a simple char, And tried to shoot myself using exiva sd. Didnt work &quot;You cannot shoot directly at players&quot;.<br />
So i took it to the next level and wrote exiva +0MyChar And smack! i hit myself with an SD. <br />
I figured it's just a matter of changing from +5 to +0. It was not.<br />
The only features available on the magebomb goes for Battlelist wich it doesnt override anyways. So now im asking, How can i solve this fatal bug?<br />
I tried looking around the forums and used google no results.<br />
<br />
Also noticed that the Magebomb feature is disabled for client 8.6<br />
Wtf is going on here? Kinda feel like i'm throwing my money in the river.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that doesn't work. Tell the naughty OT maker he should stop fucking with his OT man. He is changing it from Real tibia</div></div><hr />
