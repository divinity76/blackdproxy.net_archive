Also, I have a lifetime membership with BlackD, does this mean anything anymore? :)

<br />
However, no1 really knows how tibia's &quot;tool&quot; really works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-09-2012, 11:14</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have any reports of anyone being banned for using only other features. It looks like only the cavebot is unsafe at this moment.<br />
<br />
I think the only problem left might be in the attack, move or loot and we are working to improve that as much as possible. I already made some important fixes but I don't know if they are enough yet.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for personally replying Daniel :)  I don't plan to use the Cavebot, all I need is the safe cheats for healing and stuff. Glad to see it's safe! (Works great btw, I used it all yesterday :D)<br />

This new patch that just came out, I think I saw that it's still client version 9.44.. Could I still use  Safecheats on it? or would it be too risky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">02-10-2012, 20:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I also am wondering about that. If there's a patch that doesnt change tibia version or does change it what do we do? Can we use it or what? I mean BSC. Today BSC worked normally but what if there will be a version change?<br />
I asked there but noone seems to look over there.<br />
