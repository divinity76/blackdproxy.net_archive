Obviously ive checked my BlackD Folder, and nothing is there apart from downloaded scripts &amp; Default Ones.<br />
<br />
WHERE DOES CAVEBOT SAVE &quot;IN-GAME CREATED&quot; SCRIPTS?<br />
<br />
<br />
Im wanting to combine a few scripts, and the easiest way would be in a notepad, rather then re-writing one into the other.<br />
Thanks guys, Much appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">griffin</div><div class="date">04-19-2012, 22:23</div></div><div class="posttext">In my computer (Windows7) it saves them on C:/Users/griffin/AppData/Local/VirtualStore/Program Files (x86)/<br />
<br />

<br />
@ xHellsx - most clearly this was the first thing i did, and i think due to the fact they're hidden in app data (which i checked roughly), Must have not shown up in search index, I hope this helped everyone like me! Cheers</div></div><hr />
