Had to post this:<br />
My little brother gets in the room, watches from 1:10 to 1:20 and says: &quot;The yellow wins!&quot; and leave.<br />
Ofc I loled :P<br />
<br />
Btw, he fought with an earing. Nuts.<br />
Wtf, he hit your balls! :O<br />
<br />

Eww... disgusting...<br />
<br />
@8:04 AEW SHORYUKEN!<br />
<br />
I see you are going a little to much defensive. After successfully hitting his nose several times you went back defending your face instead of jumping into a combo of more and more punchs. You could have won that.<br />
<br />
Sidenote: Get some more weight. You are way to skinny. Not so important I guess but, a little bit of sunlight wont hurt you, just get you a little tanned :-)<br />
<br />
Anyway, you did good, for a first fight. Altho you didn't have the newbies luck :-(<br />
<br />
Edit: Is it just me or someone else remembered the Dhalsim theme song from Street Fighter as background music ? LMAO</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Yeah, definitely. Look at Webber's face at that time. He was sure enjoying it. LMAO<br />
If I had a fight like this, I would prefer having a hot girl as referee :-)<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to give tips, I just guess hes way too low weight. I was more likely to look into Sagat from street fighter as a thai fighter :-D</div></div><hr />

EDIT: lmao at the guy touching your parts xD I think he was hungry hahaha<br />
<br />

I've trained in BJJ, TKD, Muy Thai, Kenpo, and Chun Kuk Do so far, and I'd have to say you did alright. I'm probably skinnier than you, but that attributes to my speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;Wants too see your vid 2&gt;<br />
 <br />
krav magá is the real shit. in the swedish armed forces we train that as well, with a few differences from the &quot;true&quot; krav magá, mainly being simpler and relying more on bringing the opponent down, i.a kick in the balls or hammer punch to the nose.<br />
<br />
about your performance webber i found it impressive after only 3 months and no past experience. don't let your enemy take charge of the fight, be aggressive in a smart and thought-through way.</div></div><hr />

ur doing qiute well, sure hes got the &quot;over hand&quot; if thats the right formulation,<br />
but ur not dooing much mistakes or even big ones.<br />
Quiet good :)<br />
Just wished to see you more offensive from time to time hes somtimes having his own defense down while makeing a kick attack.<br />
A fast punch and u'd have him ;)<br />
<br />
Anyways keep it up and make more vids ;)<br />
Looking forward for you first k.o. ... no matter if you deal it or get it XD<br />
