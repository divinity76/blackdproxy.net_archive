	<meta name="description" content="Hello, 
I'm playing on a 7.6 Tibia OT server, I used to train against Stealth Monsters. 
They could be killed by GFB. 
I believe I used a conditional event which was $MYHP$ Number&gt;=# 1 actions taken = Exiva GFB. 
But the thing is, I forgot the Exiva number of shooting a GFB. 
I would just make a quick script and I'd spam GFB's all over the place and lvl so fast. 
Is there anyone that could help me out with this? 
Or does anyone knows a bot that works the same way? 
I spammed GFB like hell, it" />

I spammed GFB like hell, it worked like Exiva 5Demon.<br />
I kept shooting SD's with those ''White'' marks on myself that tell u that ur exhausted.<br />
I really need to know this because these monsters are giving the best XP / hour.<br />
And they are on a very safe spot that nobody can find ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">06-21-2015, 22:34</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer is <br />
exiva useitemonname:77 0C<br />
Now it will cast GFB on whatever monster you have targeted, Or<br />
exiva useitemonname:77 0C,Demon<br />
now it will cast GFB on the first Demon it finds... which makes no sense to me<br />
<br />
(Yes i know this is an old thread, but nobody ever gave the solution :p )</div></div><hr />
