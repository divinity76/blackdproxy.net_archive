	<meta name="description" content="Hi, 
For your information: this forum is a vBulletin forum (using a legal purchased license) and it requires some basic cookies - because it is a vBulletin forum. 
 
Session cookies expires after the end of the session. Rest of cookies - for decoration, preferences and personalizations - expires in 1 year. 
You can freely delete all them in your browser if you really think that they will harm you or something. 
 
If you need information I guess it would be better to ask vBulletin owners." />

Anyways, here is my contact email: daniel@blackdtools.com<br />
<br />
At registration you will also have to consent us to store your provided data. It will be stored in a secure way.<br />
You can contact me there in case you need to remove your whole account (and all your posts). Please be aware that you can only request removal of the user linked with your own email. I will also test your email ownership so forget about using fake email senders. Only legit requests will be fulfilled.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
- Daniel</div></div><hr />
