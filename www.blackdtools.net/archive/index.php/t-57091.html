<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">01-19-2012, 23:50</div></div><div class="posttext">My accounts are clean! <br />
<br />
I usually bot 3-4 accounts every day - usually up to 8 or 10 hours per day, sometimes over night too - using Blackd Tibia Multiclient, Blackd Proxy's Runmaker and Cavebot ... Just for eating food and simple cavebot script with no fancy depositer or refiller.<br />
<br />
I still believe every account is being 'checked' by the tool after someone reports it. Tho, this might not be exactly true since there's no doubt I was reported numerous times regarding my Local Chat being full of 'botter! :@', 'Booooooooot! :('<br />
<br />
I guess I was just lucky, even though I used Cavebot before BlackD launched version 22.2 with that awesome .dat file reader/updater which maybe makes it a bit safer.<br />
<br />
<br />
@BlackD ... I saw in the other thread you need 'testers' ... Well, at the moment I'm using BlackD Proxy to level up 20 chars (whole account) up to level 8 and then take those to main as knights. Just my crazy project to have at least 1000 characters in main till next time Santa Clause appears, so till Christmas 2012, cuz last time I was getting my gifts from him I got few good ones and after I've checked tibia.wikia.com I was like ... 'What?! A Bunnyslippers? Oh Mr. Santa, it's ON! Those are mine!' ... So yeah, I'll be opening a project thread in Screenshot section with all the statistics after 'rl' stuff gets easy on me ... So, I'll let you know about any kind of weirdos and of course if I'm being deleted through ban waves of 2012.</div></div><hr />

It is a good thing you get removed this round as hopefully your new characters will never make the list (ive heard storys of inactive players between banwave 1 and banwave 2 being deleted in banwave 2 even after not playing between waves) meaning you get listed possibly</div></div><hr />

NeverX :I still believe every account is being 'checked' by the tool after someone reports it. Tho, this might not be exactly true since there's no doubt I was reported numerous times regarding my Local Chat being full of 'botter! :@', 'Booooooooot! '<br />

Were you using ONLY BlackD Proxy or were that accounts of yours that got deleted used in combination with any other bot program?</div></div><hr />

This update was made 2 days ago. Quit whining. We all lose now and then. Time to see if the new update blackd done will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 19:41</div></div><div class="posttext">IF your account was already marked you were fucked anyway. <br />
<br />
this is 100% true : if you was already detected it does not matter if you format your whole computer and don't play tibia again: you will be deleted anyways.<br />
<br />
Anyways I must say that I made new chars and I caveboted 2 hours with each of them using version 22.2 and none of them was deleted, so that is a good signal.<br />
<br />
I also must say that I will ignore deletion reports from unknown persons because some persons might be here only to damage the reputation of this bot. I only will consider the deletion reports of mods and users with well known good reputation who made new accounts since 22.2<br />
<br />
For now I can't know that it is safe or not. However after the survival status of this first testing stage I think it is very probably safe and that is what I told to some of my rl friends who will start botting on high level chars for the second stage of my internal safety tests.<br />
<br />
Note for the users: I won't give any safety guarantee about my free bots. There will be never any kind of compensation for deletion. I only will state my opinions about the current status about autodetection.<br />
<br />
Current status of Blackd Proxy: All my test accounts created after version 22.2 survived to 1 ban wave.<br />
Current status of Blackd Safe Cheats: There are still zero reports of deletion from people who only used this small pack of cheats. I think this one is 100% safe as always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">After this ban wave there are so many idiots posting here complaining that they got banned when they knew the risks and had been botting before the new fixs for blackd...<br />
<br />
I'm holding back from going on a RAGE BAN HAMMER RAMPAGE!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravhul</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I know its not a place for this but:<br />
Could you add more slots for healing in Blackd Safe Cheats, Blackd? At least 3 would be awesome because a mage needs to use 3 healings all the time :)<br />
I hope that you will consider adding that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About the cavebot safety: Hans Henrik discovered several possibly detectable things at the cavebot code and I will fix all them in the following version, in 2 or 3 days.<br />
<br />
I don't recommend using cavebot in main chars yet! Only farm gold with lowlevels for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
On the druid i used the fallowing freatures &gt; Eat food and mana train, i also applied the FPS helper and hidded the tibia window all times.<br />
<br />
On the knight i just used anti-logout.<br />
I was training 10-14hrs per day...<br />
<br />
The two characters survived that ban-wave</div></div><hr />
