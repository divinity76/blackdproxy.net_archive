Did you ever wonder why CIP only ban few chars thats cheat, and not all?<br />
Why you had 40 accounts botting and only one got caught?<br />
<br />
It took me 2 accounts with deletion warning since I came back to tibia but.. it was worth I think.<br />
<br />
How I did notice it? Playing everyday with 5 accounts.<br />
<br />
When I started to play tibia again , I created 5 accounts, always following the same pattern.<br />
<br />
Start up PC:<br />
Load Blackd Proxy<br />
Load Tibia Client<br />
Load Tibia Client<br />
Load Tibia Client<br />
Load Tibia Client<br />
Load Tibia Client<br />
Log in first character<br />
Log in second character<br />
Log in third character<br />
Log in fourth character<br />
Log in five character<br />
<br />
Do the same during 2 weeks, then I repeat pattern...<br />
Load blackd-&gt; load 5 clients -&gt; try to log in first character and then...<br />
<br />
 -------------------<br />
Downloading new object.....<br />
 -------------------<br />
<br />
Close Blackd-&gt; Close all cleitns<br />
Load Tibia without blackd<br />
Update<br />
<br />
Then again , log in blackd- &gt; open all clients -&gt; log in five characters.<br />
<br />
Nothing happened? or it did?.<br />
<br />
What actually happened it that CIP made &quot;small patch&quot; and for that, I coudln't update tibia because I was using a cheat and I already sent them my password almost saying &quot;Yes , I am a cheater!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
After 2 days on 07/12/2009:<br />
I log on tibia, and guess what, only first character got banned.<br />
<br />
Bad luck? Everyone said it was ramdom, but I wasn't so sure.<br />
<br />
So I went again to work (Of course, of the 5 chars they banned the one who had 10 millon gp , so I had to hunt rots a while xD)<br />
<br />
Creating new char.. <br />
Follow pattern again:<br />
Log blackd, load clients, log in with all characters, always in same order.<br />
12 days later, again, suddenly tibia &quot;got kicked&quot; and after that, we had to download a patch, even knowing this theory , you prolly got banned, since suddenly relogged tibia to avoid the dead ofthe character.<br />
<br />
 -------------------<br />
Downloading new object.....<br />
 -------------------<br />
<br />
Closed client, update -&gt; going cheat again.<br />
<br />
after 2 days on 23/12/09 (or it was 22, but it doesn't matter), guess what...<br />
<br />
the first character I logged (which of course I sent a bad packet to CIP with my login/pass) got banned, but others didn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what you should do to avoid this almost 100%, especially cash maker and 24 hours trainers/afk bot:<br />
<br />
Log in without cheats, check if there is a updated , then udpate it and after, close it, adn log in with cheats.<br />
<br />
And what CIP made second time: Make small patch for check cheaters at 20/12/2009, kick everyone from servers, so you prolly didn't even check for patch.<br />
<br />
To avoid this... It's sad to say.. after kick, don't reconect with cheats.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
P.D.: I already said my english sux<br />
P.D2: I will post my new scripts for leveling from 1 to 100 cheap and fast soon in scrip forum, stay alert xD<br />
Hint: if for any reason you get a downloading object with cheat, you can send your money to other char.. xD<br />
<br />
<br />
Also forgot to say: Why did only few elfbot user get banned? Because in Elfbot , you first log in without cheats and then put elf bot, but on the &quot;kicks&quot; made by CIP, they relog with elf bot, and they can't update tibia client either.<br />
<br />
P.D3: If you are a CM from CIP reading this... why you didn't reply me my chrismast card? xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always run eflbot before logging in but got only one noob acc banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;downloading new object&quot;<br />
<br />
I'v never seen it, but I'v never been banned. I presume it is patch.exe that is patching the client at this point and if the above is true then the reason I'm unbanned is that I always remove patch.exe after every update.</div></div><hr />
