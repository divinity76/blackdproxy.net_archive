somone posted this in a video:<br />
<br />
The game costs $49.99 and they give you 50 hours of gametime. Once your game time is expired, you can choose between two payment methods from as little as $6.99 for an additional 20 hours, while more frequent players can switch to a 30-day unlimited package for only $9.99 with discounts available for 90 and 180 days.<br />
This only applies to action districts, the game also has social districts where players can customize their characters, clothing, cars &amp; weapons for free without buying gametime</div></div><hr />

On April 30 2010, a press release was published by official fansite APB Evolved - which included a release date and pricing information. The game is due for release on June 29 2010 in North America, July 1 in Mainland Europe and July 2 in the United Kingdom.[1] A subscription-like system will be used, where players purchase game time for action districts, either by purchasing hours or by opting for an unlimited playtime option for 30 days. Players will be required to purchase a copy of the game, which will have an SRP of $49.99 in the United States, £34.99 in the United Kingdom and &#8364;49.99 in Europe, and will include 50 hours of initial game time.[1] Both the game and the website will be available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian and English.
