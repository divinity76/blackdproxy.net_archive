I guess I was doing something wrong as I have not heard of anyone else getting caught.<br />
I never went AFK whilst botting I only use to use it for mana recharge.<br />
Also when making runes auto feed and usual runemaking.<br />
Oh well it's the risk we all run, Tibia has now lost me as a customer so has Blackd, as I shall no longer require his services.<br />
Many thanks Daniel for your service it has been great, all the gold I have bought in the past was excellent and well in the time frames that you specified, a unique and trouble free service.<br />
Bye to all.</div></div><hr />

The thread was only supposed to be for users who ONLY use Blackd Safe Cheats.<br />
 <br />
Well, I think it is clear that BSC is still 100% safe.</div></div><hr />
