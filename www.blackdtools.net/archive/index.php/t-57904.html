	<meta name="description" content="Hello! 
 
I made a new druid in Premia and I need some advice on how to lvl it fast, without worrying about waste. And I usually hunt solo due to lack of blocker. 
 
I am level 33 already. -  I've been hunting in Cycs and get around 70k/h with boost (Looking for places like this or better) 
 
Please give me advice of where and what to hunt. If you got links to guides I am open too. 
Also suggestions for quests and/tasks are welcomed. 
 
If you want to hunt with me let me know and I will gladly" />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ridah</div><div class="date">04-30-2012, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">go vamps in tarpit tomb. run the whole tomb without looting, but wasting a little per level, insane exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">04-30-2012, 23:22</div></div><div class="posttext">That's what I was doing: running cyc without looting unless great loot (once only) and I got up to like 80k/h.<br />
<br />
I will try tarpit today and let you know my results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">05-02-2012, 06:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I did what you suggested for a while and got around 70k/h. It is definitely a better spawn than cyc and some nicer loot could come out.<br />
<br />
When can I try yalahar or darashia dragons? Maybe some demons skeletons at the beginning?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ridah</div><div class="date">05-02-2012, 12:45</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i was hunting vamps to level 50. then worker golems in yalahar, was pretty waste, but also nice exp. u can go dragons now already</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which vampires? Which Dragons?<br />
What spells did you use with workers?<br />
<br />
Sorry for too many questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ridah</div><div class="date">05-03-2012, 13:48</div></div><div class="posttext">vampires in ank, tarpit tomb. dragons in yalahar, ank or dara :) <br />
workers did i use exori vis + death rod (cause of the frost dragon hatchlings) :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">05-05-2012, 09:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't wait to  try those areas, thanks.<br />
<br />
Anymore suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I don't think I ever got your in-game name, or I just forgot it, but I'm back on Premia tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
