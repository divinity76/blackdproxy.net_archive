Yes, I am aware that this increase of forum users here is related to the expected death of Neobot in the next big patch.<br />
<br />
I should remember everybody that all my tools and cheats are safe at this moment, except the cavebot function of Blackd Proxy. Nothing else is unsafe here.<br />
<br />
I don't discard trying to make a new -safe- cavebot if Neobot really dies in the next patch, but I can't guarantee that yet. In any case I always will try to keep my tools updated.<br />
<br />
Anyways I also know that some people are working on new safe bots. I might support one of the new bots and I would sell it in my site in that case, but there is nothing solid there yet. That might take several months and we will also need later a lot of tests to see if it is really safe against the automatic detection.</div></div><hr />

i've been training a high lvl knight using blackd tools just to keep it from logging off, so far so good, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-12-2012, 14:14</div></div><div class="posttext">cavebot should work better in latest version 22.0.<br />
I fixed a problem with the attack packet that was probably being detected as cheat. Anyways I can't guarantee 100% safety yet.<br />
<br />
And maybe we will have new features in the bot soon. A new programmer is voluntary making improvements in the code.</div></div><hr />
