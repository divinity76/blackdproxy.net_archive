So far I only got 1 report of 1 person that said he got ban with blackd proxy cavebot in last ban wave at Tibia 9.00.  
HOWEVER, he was a new user in this forum (post count=1), and he didn't seem to have any blackd proxy license, at least not in his registered email. I asked him for his license email and he ignored me. No answer after a week, so I deleted his post. I think that was probably a fake report. How" />
