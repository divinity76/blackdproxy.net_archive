<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-10-2012, 00:05</div></div><div class="posttext">With current version of Blackd Proxy you can make a simple script for autolooting all:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
setBot LootAll=1<br />
setLootDistance 1<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
<br />
<br />
Important note: It is a very simple script and I think that it is not detectable, but I won't guarantee that yet.<br />
<br />
note2: it will give alarm because you are not adding any creature to be killed. It will think that a pk is attacking you and it will give alarm with any monster. I will try to make a new cavebot command to disable this alarm in the next version...</div></div><hr />

Just gotta add any possible attackers to Runemaker safelist to avoid the alarm. Also you should set &quot;setLootDistance&quot; to 0 (if possible without crashing the bot, not sure) or atleast to 1 so it will never walk to distant corpses to loot them.</div></div><hr />

For now add the creatures you will be hunting to runemaker safelist.</div></div><hr />

Anyways I will try to add a cavebot command to disable that alarm for everything, as soon I have some time.</div></div><hr />
