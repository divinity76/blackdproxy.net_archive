I was about to buy some gold when I was required to fill up some questions about me (like name, addresss, national identification number) for a invoice. Why is that needed?

That is not needed, I always write false stuff and never had any problem xD</div></div><hr />

Actually it seems weird to me, as selling/buying tibian cash is illegal, according to Cipsoft's rules. Or am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexxis123</div><div class="date">02-22-2011, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I thaugt that it aint iligall, since selling pacc isnt illigal to but it aint allowed to advertise it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-26-2011, 13:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, we are forced to request such information because this is a 100% legal business and web needs to generate legal invoices containing such information, mainly for tax purposes. But we are also forced to keep that information in case police needs it for any kind of terrorism money tracking. If you invent something there that is no problem at all with me!, but I hope police doesn't need to track your purchases. If they see you inventing information there then they might think that you have something to hide. Anyways I guess there are like 0,0001% chances of this to ever happen.<br />
 <br />
Btw: selling gold in Tibia is ALLOWED by Cipsoft. Only ingame advertisement is against their GAME rules (notice that in any case they are only GAME rules, not REAL LIFE laws) Anyways we don't do any ingame advertisement at all.</div></div><hr />
