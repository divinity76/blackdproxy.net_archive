First off i would like to say that i am aware that CRACKING is definitely not supported on blackd... but since there's no other way to get such software, i guess an exception could be made toward this matter. 
 
now that it seems impossible to request keys (yes, i had a lifetime license), anyone knows a SAFE way to crack elf ? 
 
please avoid replys as &quot;google it&quot; since google results for cracks are mainly hacks/trojans/keyloggers or w/e. 
 
Thanks !" />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-08-2012, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, well, considering that it is now abandonware I guess it is ok if someone post a crack method or a small code to get it working with a minimum change. That would be the only safe way. <br />
<br />
I recommend this: Do not trust any free exe file of anyone unless it is open source! 90% of the cracks always come with troyans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Long time ago I had a crack that was safe and elf was fully working, it was not .exe we just had to change a .dll file and it'd work. however I lost the crack and I dont remember the version<br />
<br />
well blackd you could crack it for us :P if you manage to make it work then we would know that its safe</div></div><hr />

If he have nothing to hide then I guess he should not care sharing the code so you can check its safety and then you can recompile it.<br />
<br />
If he added a troyan to it then I guess he won't like to share the code :)</div></div><hr />

If the crack is infected its still very dangerous to even think about entering the website as it might try to download things to ur computer<br />
<br />
I wouldnt risk entering any website about it but thats just me</div></div><hr />

if your windows is updated and you don't accept to install anything when you enter a web then a web should not be able to infect you.</div></div><hr />

if some1 wants the crack, feel free to pm me !</div></div><hr />

But if there is no other option than using it then I recommend you to only use that computer to play ot server and nothing else: Better don't play real tibia in that computer. Better don't use your credit card/paypal in that computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bOTtter</div><div class="date">04-11-2012, 16:19</div></div><div class="posttext">yea man u should've atleast sent the file to virus total and companies like kaspersky and wait a day or 2 to see their answer before executing it<br />
<br />
where did u get it from?<br />
<br />
I think that elf doesnt even have an official site anymore, does it?<br />
<br />
now that it doesnt have an online authenticator it should be easier to make ur own crack/keygen through reverse engineering and debugging too bad im just a noob xd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rowhan</div><div class="date">04-11-2012, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">I gave him the crack, dunno where I found it though, so I don't have the source to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-12-2012, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Feel free to post that crack here. However I reject any responsability on it, and as I said in my previous post: you better only use it in a computer that you ONLY use for your OT server and nothing else.<br />
<br />
If anyone detect any strange behaviour like that tool connecting to strange sites then please report it.<br />
Proposal: try opening a cmd window and type<br />
netstat -a<br />
that way you can see to what sites you are connected.<br />
Test doing it before running the crack and After running the crack. Then compare results.</div></div><hr />

I'll try that later when I have some freetime, and if it looks okay I'll upload it to whoever that wants it!:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've recently started to play 8.6 OT where botting is allowed, even tutors are helping players with ElfBot scripting ... I've never had or used Elf before so I thought I should give it a go ...<br />
<br />
Here's the crack: http://www.tibiabrasil.net/2010/07/evolution-crack-para-elfbot-458-860.html<br />
<br />
Now, I'm very laid back when comes to downloading files that aren't official, but I dunno why, I've trusted this one and it's working great.<br />
<br />
Just follow instructions and you'll be good to go. I mean, those are in portuguese, but just watching tutorial video on youtube is enough, you don't have to understand anything that guy is saying.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, you can dowload ElfBot and crack for version 8.6, forgot to mention that.<br />
<br />
Have fun and post back if you got any problems! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosforo</div><div class="date">04-26-2012, 04:29</div></div><div class="posttext">i used the one posted above and it worked smooth.<br />
<br />
Still, use it at your own risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-26-2012, 15:33</div></div><div class="posttext">my antivirus (Microsoft Security Essentials) detected a troyan in that crack, and I am afraid it is not a false positive. But it is up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">04-26-2012, 21:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine hasn't detected anything, been using it for couple of days now, works smooth, besides, 90% of that OT server (which is lame btw -.-) I'm playing, with like 400-500 players online, uses that crack.<br />
<br />
Of course, anyone should use it at his own risk. That's for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-27-2012, 13:24</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Anyways you better avoid using paypal/credit cards/real tibia accounts in that computer if you use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fosforo</div><div class="date">04-28-2012, 06:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Anyways you better avoid using paypal/credit cards/real tibia accounts in that computer if you use it.<br />
<br />
how can you say if its a false positive or not just by reading the scan ? mind sharing that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-28-2012, 10:02</div></div><div class="posttext">microsoft security essentials rarely gives false positives if you compare it with most antiviruses. that is all. but of course it can be a false positive too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoxBox</div><div class="date">04-28-2012, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I reported false positive to Avira and that's what I got:<br />
<br />
&quot;The file 'ElfCrack.exe' has been determined to be 'FALSE POSITIVE'. In particular this means that this file is not malicious but a false alarm. Detection will not be removed due to the fact that the file does not belong to a regular piece of software. This software can be used for an evasion of security protections in several computer programs. If we will find some malicious code inside the suspicious file anyway, we will integrate the pattern recognition in one of our next updates. In case AntiVir can detect this file we will not change or remove our detection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Crack was detected, not malware. That's what I think.</div></div><hr />
