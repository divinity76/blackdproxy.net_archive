In order to guarantee an effective protection, the rules have to be enforceable by the ones that are entrusted with this task. With the farewell of the gamemasters back in August, Tibia's rule enforcement system has started to change. Our inhouse customer support team has taken over the task to process incoming reports from players and to enforce the rules wherever it is needed. As the wording of the Tibia Rules has not changed since then, the time has come to adapt the rules to the new situation. Below we have summarised the major adaptions for you that will take effect with the release of the winter update:<br />
<br />
 In the game and on the boards, the posting of links to other websites will be basically allowed, given that the links do not violate another Tibia Rule. In other words, you may then link to your favourite video on YouTube, to your Twitter account, to your Facebook profile etc. However, hack links, links to websites that sell Tibia gold or links that clearly advertise other products, for example, will still be forbidden.<br />
With this rule change we want to accomodate all players who wished for a more liberal dealing with web links while keeping an adequate level of protection for the community as a whole. Nevertheless, we still advise everybody to not follow links to unsupported websites blindly.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You will be allowed to speak in your native language in the game and on the boards. However, there are a couple of places in the forum where the use of English will still be explicitly required and enforced. These include the Auditorium, the Event board and the Proposal board. <br />
Moreover, please note that customer support will continue to be available exclusively in English. If you write to our support team in any other language, your request cannot be considered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 Rule 3b concerning the abuse of game weaknesses will be removed. In return, further measures will be taken to solve game design problems wherever needed. Have a look at the first measures below. Also, multi-clienting will not be covered by a separate rule in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
     With the winter update, first game design adaptions will be implemented to remove game weaknesses. Lured creatures will walk back to their respawn places as soon as they lose their target. Further, players will not be able to rope wild creatures any more. Respawn blocking will also be impossible at the respawn places of the Inquisition quest bosses and the black knight.<br />
     In addition to that, players will be able to pass through other players in protection zones on all game world types. Thus, trapping and blocking in protection zones will be solved or at the very least considerably alleviated.<br />
<br />
The final version of the new Tibia Rules can be looked up after the release of the winter update.<br />
