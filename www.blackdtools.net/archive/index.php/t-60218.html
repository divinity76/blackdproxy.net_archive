Hey Brother <br />
<br />
because it took so long? you could implement this update that chart pull the loot to the floor? kill something when throwing to the floor? Minotaur example the loot? if only money and creature product pickup and throw items to the ground. this would be very good and very attractive which would bring many new people which would do grow a little proxy page :p I expect a prompt response. Doing this as a gift to all who USAMO long proxy :p</div></div><hr />

You can already tell the cavebot to drop the loot on the floor.</div></div><hr />

And it is still very detectable so I don't recommend using this tool in real servers yet.<br />
<br />
The rest of my tools should be still undetectable.</div></div><hr />

Hey !<br />
<br />
Excuse yourself the trouble. but I have a question and you answered me understanding little. I understand that I can throw the loot to the floor &quot;as long as I have in my backpack using the (DroopLootOnGround) I want to know is if it is possible to kill a Minotaur and opening the body throwing items on the floor and just pick up the money • If this is possible could you explain how? hope early reply thanks.</div></div><hr />

This is not possible. Just loot the items, and every waypoint just drop them on the floor. RESETLOOT to ensure you aren't dropping your GP/creature produce on the ground.</div></div><hr />

Sorry,  I don't have time to add new features to blackd proxy at this moment.<br />
Fixing detection and stability problems have higher priority right now.</div></div><hr />
