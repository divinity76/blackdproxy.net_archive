<br />
Is There Any Rule's?<br />
<br />
Yes, You Must Have Money In Real Life To Transfer A Char To Another World.<br />
Now You Also Must Have Premium Account... <br />
And We Can Leave Dolera From Level 45 If You Guy's Wish To Go Fast And Pwn That Server.<br />
Also You Must Have Good Pvp Skill's, Don't Be A Thief, And Have The Same Zone Time Of My Town, Mexico. And You Need To Have Ventrilo (Only When We Are At Inferna) &lt; For War Etc... Right Now If We Start We Are Low Lvl's No Need To Use Ventrilo, Oh Btw You Need To Understand Atleast English Or Spanish, If Not Don't Message ME Or Pm ME, I Think That's Pretty Much It For Now Remember The Point Is To Own Inferna, Dont Tell Me Oh Come To My Server I'll Ignore You Guy's<br />
<br />
I Also Have Another Plan Like Pking In A Pvp World, Why? Because We Got Something That's Called Stamina And For Us To Generate The Stamina We Must Log And Sometimes We Don't Have Nothing To Do And It Would Be Awesome To Play In Two World's But Those Char's Can Be Low Lvl's 20 Or 30's Then We Can Also Lvl Them Up But It's Just Fun Like To Pk Someone A Lot OF High Lvl's <br />
<br />
Now How's A Great Idea To Not Get A Frag, Well We Can Start Luring Someone With A Red Skull, Ok For An Example Im The Red Skull In Thais Then I See A Level 140 Elite Knight OR Knight Doesn't Matter Well It Actually Does But Ok The Point Is I Lure Someone Then We Are In Ventrilo Then You Guys Log In Some Place Then I Tell You Went To Log... Ok Now Imagine Im Luring Then You Guy's Know Where Is The Mana Shop On Thais Right? Ok ... Down There On South \/ There's Like A Farm Correct? You Guys Log Inside There There's Like 2 Trees Down Then (Imagine You Guy's Are In Those Trees I Mean Near Those Trees) Then I Move Him Inside Those 2 Trees, Then Ill Tell You Guy's To Log On 2 Noob's Char's To Just Trap Him Don't Attak The Knight, Then He Will Be Traped Then Like Someone Log With Me To Attak Him And He Will Be Scared Thinking Someone Else Going To Attak And Btw I Forgot To Tell You Guys In The Farm Theres Like A Path We Can Put A Knight There Blocking So Nobody Passes Well Ok Then He Will Be Like Oh Shit They Are Going To Kill Me &lt; On That Part Is When He Have's Little Of Health's Now Like 100 Dunno Then Like He Would Attak The Noob's Chars Then If He Get's White Skull Evryone Log's On The Lvls 20s or 30s And Pwn Him Without Getting Frag... So Thats A Nice Way To Pk And We Must Go To A Full World Very Full So We Can Kill Dif Type Of Persons Well Thats Now Pretty Much It About This...<br />

<br />
Official Fraglist: Waterloo [397] vs Crimson Sunset [216]<br />
<br />
<br />
we are winning this war and we are like 40!!! but if we get around 20 person's on this server and u know when people start's then some other people want to start so we could easy have around 40 or 50 but u know i just want to start with 20 who knows maybe 30 idk im just inviting you guy's to join this project n shit it doesnt waste your time u can get easy in 1 week and 3 or 4 day's to lvl 45 if u dont know where to hunt ill tell you guy's and like i said i hope this would be awesome we could make a family and shit so if u guys want to enter msg me send me a private msg or leave your hotmail here thanks guy's for your attention ~ <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And i forgot to tell you guy's about the pvp project well we dont need like 15 persons with 6 or 7 person's its ok so we can have 2 mc each of us so it could be around 12 person's or 14 well all that i could give u info by msn ok guys</div></div><hr />
