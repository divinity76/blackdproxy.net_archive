More detailed information about the problem:<br />
The script starts by checking your inventory for any loot that can be sold. If there is nothing to sell it will check the amount of potions in your inventory with:<br />
<br />
IfTrue ($countitems:0A 01$#number&lt;#3) Goto $nlineoflabel:buyPotion$<br />
If you have 3 or more health potions (item ID:0A 01) with you it will proceed hunting. After selling any loot it will check for your potions with the same line. If there is need for more potions it will move to the following line where it will check for any leftover loot to sell and if the required amount of money for the 5 potions is present. If not it will withdraw the amount of money from the bank and then buy the potions from the shop (and deposit any empty flasks (1D 01) if present)<br />

After depositing any remaining gold it will go back to the top of the script where it will check for loot and potions again before it starts hunting again. However sometimes it decides to buy new potions over and over while the count is definitely higher than 2. Which should trigger hunting and not buying potions again. I know the script goes back to the top after buying the potions. This didn't make sense to me since I don't see a problem with the line there. Even if it decides to buy potions again, it should jump to the deposit line since I put this line at the start of every label concerning the potions:<br />
<br />
IfTrue ($countitems:0A 01$#number&gt;#2) Goto $nlineoflabel:deposit$<br />
I don't get errors while running the script so there aren't any typo's in it. I am just confused that it doesn't recognize the last mentioned line when it uses the same item ID that does get recognized when buying the potions. Is there some command I am missing here that prevents this from happening?<br />
<br />
Help pls!</div></div><hr />
