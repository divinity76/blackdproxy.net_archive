I'll try it on tarantula boss with my mage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">07-04-2012, 17:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Worked it out, it is literally just firebomb it, then let it walk onto a natural peice of fire and slowly let it burn to death. The fact you do less than 50% of the damage means it isn't &quot;your kill&quot;<br />
<br />
Isn't as profitable as I first thought as silks don't always drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">celje123</div><div class="date">07-05-2012, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you mind shareing the whole process?<br />
<br />
I tried fire bombing a few of the bosses and then let them walk over some firefields while they chase me... <br />
At the end I still got credit for the kill...<br />
<br />
What level char were you using?<br />
How long before you firefields became natural? Or where did you get a natural peice of fire? :D<br />
<br />
I have read that firefields cease beeing &quot;your&quot; after 6 secounds... But when i tried to kill some bosses with them it still gave me credit :p<br />
<br />
Thank you alot :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">07-05-2012, 01:50</div></div><div class="posttext">It only works on the lower bosses without selfheal.<br />
<br />
Just firebomb the creature then make it walk into the center of the firebomb with the first &quot;burn&quot; as this burn is caused by you it will chase you after the first burn.<br />
<br />
Then let it die slowly to the natural fire it just walked into.<br />
<br />
(takes like 5-6 mins to die of burning)<br />
<br />
then take loot and leave and go ask for boss again. You should gain little or no exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">07-06-2012, 23:11</div></div><div class="posttext">what do you mean with the 'first' burn?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you understand that when you stand on a fire field it causes DAMAGE OVER TIME. called burning?</div></div><hr />

<br />
OFC I DO.<br />
<br />
I meant to ask if there is any trick to it? <br />
do i have to shoot it on the ground without hitting the creature and then lure it on the fire after a period of time or just simply hit it and wait till it dies?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hit it, then make it walk into the center of the firebomb with the first burn (first burn will be your damage - thus meaning it can walk over a firefield during this burn)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since bug abuse is legal. And this bug has been around for 2 years, I don't think they can punish people for it.<br />
<br />
CIPsoft are aware of the bug, and unlike the exp bug (where people were punished) they haven't done any actions as of yet. EXP bug action was taken in 12hours~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinnie</div><div class="date">07-09-2012, 17:05</div></div><div class="posttext">But to be on the safe side wouldn't it be best not to use your main account?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I doubt cipsoft are going to delete or even banish around 4000~ premium accounts who used a bug in which they would have to include characters that also didn't use the bug but just did the task legitimately.<br />
<br />
But tbh, I happened to not have a character 50- to do the task, so did it on a friends lower level account. Haha.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have fear though.</div></div><hr />

And when I leave the NPC gryzli Adams and ask to go back to kill a boss he tells me that I had already been killed. Where is the mistake? Does we need something special to write?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You clearly killed it, rather than letting it burn to enviromental fire.<br />
<br />
Can't believe people can't understand the difference between your fire and enviromental fire.</div></div><hr />

Because I have another possible way of killing those bosses, if it's still possible I can give You some more details<br />
<br />
By another I mean that You still need to use fire bomb but You can even kill a boss which heals</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">07-11-2012, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">We have addressed a game weakness issue that allowed players to loot paw and fur society bosses multiple times by using magic fields to kill them:<br />
If a monster gets killed by a magic field, the player who created this field will now always count as the killer of this monster no matter when the field was created. Please note that this change only applies to PvM, it does not apply to PvP situations.<br />
