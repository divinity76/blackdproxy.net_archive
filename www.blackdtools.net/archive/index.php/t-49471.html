Ye it's the problem but i think that Daniel can easy fix it:<br />
-Destroying items,walking on house packages<br />
-Non-pvp mode=Ignoring players</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">szyszek7</div><div class="date">03-30-2010, 20:41</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm.. nice idea but... I think he have his own idea how to make it :p<br />
<br />
anyway not bad but need to fix some things ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flamer</div><div class="date">04-08-2010, 23:51</div></div><div class="posttext">How will it simulate a click? Like attacking mosnters, looting etc..?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luzorur</div><div class="date">06-01-2010, 07:01</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm of course it is always the best idea to simulate human movements, but well dont you think it's a bit raw? xD I know I  know everything isnt perfect form the start xD<br />
<br />
I would love to know, if someone has more information about how WoW Glider works. I mean, WoW Glider was battling against BLIZZARD ENTERTAINMENT, not ShitSoft Gmbh :P<br />
anyways perhaps they could've detected them but they decided  to sue them instead... and they won.. obiously LOL they could hire good attorneys.<br />
<br />
I got the feeling that WoW Glider must've simulated human actions pretty well, to be able to get this far.. or was it a blizz conspiration? xD<br />
<br />
my two cents//</div></div><hr />
