I´ve been brainstorming about how this auto detection tool wroks. Ofc its all speculations but still, hope this might help someone<br />
<br />
Concidering how they would want to descriminate against vocations I guess it would be something that all the vocations do while botting<br />
here is a list of things I think likely they (CIP with the tool) would attack<br />
<br />
<br />
-Healing/Potions<br />
they could have made some search bot that detects if you always auto heal after 80% or always mana up at 50%. So if there is a tool that has an eye on you and sees you heal 1000 times 0-1 sec after you go under 80%HP. Then they can find out the exact precent that you have your bot on, and kind of be sure that your botting. <br />
So like randoming that would help I think (50-80% exura 20-50% mana pot). And at a random time after the hp/mana loss, so like 1-3 sec after u get under that certain hp/mana.<br />
<br />
-Walking<br />
I´m thinking about the if they were to spot sertain sqm systems then it would help to have the script like a cople of routes of the hunting route you use<br />
<br />
-Constant sending out data/commands<br />
I´m thinking about making my scripts Wait 2-3 sec in all my scripts (would be good to have it in random places)<br />
But never the less, I have no idea how to counter this idea well.<br />
<br />
-Looting<br />
I dont know about this one<br />
<br />
-Attacking,<br />
I dont know about this one<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. I heard someone got banned for just using the healing tool, and since its a part of the game that all players have to work with /and bots I figure the -Healing/Potion part and Constantly sending out data is the things that I´m going to work on. But the Random 1-3 sec after HP/mana loss healing featus would be something I´d want to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bad packets and impossible packets are the other detectable things, like we used to beable to buy 500 pots at once instead of 5x 100.<br />
<br />
Blackd is working in fixing packet problems and with custom randomisers at each part of the bot randomisation is not an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but about the randomisation not being an issue in each part of the bot. Do you meen the scripts have been made? =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">05-01-2012, 01:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Each section has a randomiser between x and y ms so nothing will be done exactly the same unless by chance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">knusi</div><div class="date">05-01-2012, 01:26</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.<br />
<br />
I think the certain precentages could still be a factor since it could have a range of 1-2 secs after % drop under your chosen precentage. So i´ll be looking for or making scripts with like exura on 50-80% health<br />
<br />
ps thanks for the replys</div></div><hr />
