i got between 43k and 50k exp/h and about 7k/h loots halberds, leather, sword ring those are the main things i was after add or remove your own. their is a little waste but all depends on luck if you will come out with a profit this was made purely for exp not so much cash at this level will become more porffitable as your levels increase.<br />
<br />
fix the kill creature orc cyclops :P to cyclops<br />

And then you can make profit there.</div></div><hr />
