- I attempted to install a mod for the game Minecraft (shortly after this, the Internet stopped working, but that was at a similar time that the Windows Update thing came up in the corner)<br />
- I left the Windows update on while shutting down for about 30 minutes (I decided to restart because the Internet wasn't working), figured that it had broken on 2 of 4, since it had been on it for about 30 minutes, so I (regrettably) 'held down the button'<br />
<br />
Next time I booted, I was able to log in, but after the Welcome thing disappeared, there was just a black screen with the cursor.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to fix the problem throughout the day (it has been frustrating me for about the past 7 and a half hours). Here are the things I have tried:<br />
- I tried System Restore. After it giving me loads of different different errors and sorting out each one in turn (including removing my Norton), it ended it restoring, but nothing changed: I could not get in<br />
- I tried Ctrl+Alt+Del to open up the Task Manager, I closed the explorer.exe process and opened it, which fired up the desktop etc. I pretty much everything before. The only problem being that the Internet still refuses to connect (yes, I have tried the standard things like resetting router etc. and I can access the Internet from other computers)<br />
- I tried the Prevx Shell Fix thing, didn't work<br />
- I tried Startup Repair, but it said &quot;If you have any cameras or other devices attached, please remove them&quot;. I do not have any devices attached<br />
- I've scanned with Norton Extreme Security<br />
- I've done the hardware check thing Callaway RAZR X Irons (http://www.golfplayer18.com/Callaway-RAZR-X-Iron-Set-3-9PS-16582.html)<br />
<br />
I am close to punching the screen!<br />
<br />
Please help, all help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />
