setSpellKill and setHmmKill spams. Makes healing and drinking manas near impossible.<br />
<br />
setFollow blows. It's nearly impossible to kill summoners for example because it just walks around. If you use this with the client's follow you still run around alot and there is a big risk the bot will walk on levelchanging tiles or magic fields. If you use setNoFollow with the client's follow the bot will continue walking to the next waypoint before stopping to kill monsters.<br />
<br />
setAvoidFront could do better when facing two mobs, also when chasing after the mob.<br />
<br />
Ability to unselect lines in the textwindow with the script. Now you need to create a random line and remove it to have the pointer move the last position, or save/load script.<br />
<br />
As always... A better looter would be great, that only opens bodies with items in them and doesn't fail to open as many bodies as it does today.<br />
And keeping distance from mobs... Still missing from this otherwise great bot.<br />
<br />
Just what grinds my gears.</div></div><hr />
