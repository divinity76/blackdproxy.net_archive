I then placed an order for 3kk, first time ever buying gold and was really nervous. I was spending some of the money I made from my tax return, and didn't want to waste it. Sure enough within TWENTY MINUTES of placing the order I had an e-mail from BlackD himself (I'm guessing because of a question I had asked him through e-mail) saying it was sent. And sure enough I had 3.3kk in bank. 300k extra too (I guess was part of the deal, but the website didn't make that clear, so it was a nice surprise!)<br />
<br />
Not only is this the cheapest gold I've seen anywhere on PVP server, but they have A HUGE stockpile, and are quick and trustworthy. THANK YOU BLACKD!</div></div><hr />

I must admit that we are not so fast always, but nowadays we try to do our best. If we are in front of screen and we notice a new order ready for delivery we try to deliver it instantly. We are not always in front of screen, but I think we delivered everything in less than 2 days this last month. We still should only guarantee &quot;up to 7 days&quot;, just in case of unexpected rare problems.</div></div><hr />
