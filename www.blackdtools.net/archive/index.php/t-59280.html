You have to use &quot;proxy&quot; tool:<br />
1. press clear logs <br />
2. go near door that u want to open and close that doors.<br />
3. check &quot;Log Packets&quot; <br />
4. open doors<br />
5. uncheck &quot;Log Packets&quot;<br />
There should be few lines with hex code<br />
There are 2 kinds of that: <br />
Gameserver - incoming hex from server<br />
Gameclient - hex that you send to server<br />
You recorded only opening doors so there will be just one Gameclient sequence.<br />
It will look like that:<br />
<br />
GAMECLIENT1&gt;( hex ) 0F 00 78 4D 7E 29 7C 08 1D 01 02 4C 7E 29 7C 08 01 <br />
You have to cut just code:<br />
<br />
0F 00 78 4D 7E 29 7C 08 1D 01 02 4C 7E 29 7C 08 01<br />
<br />
Now if you want to open doors you have just to send this code. You can check that it works by typing<br />
<br />
exiva &gt; 0F 00 78 4D 7E 29 7C 08 1D 01 02 4C 7E 29 7C 08 01<br />
in default channel. Your character will open doors.<br />
<br />
Or if you want add it to cavebot just add this line:<br />
<br />
fastexiva &gt; 0F 00 78 4D 7E 29 7C 08 1D 01 02 4C 7E 29 7C 08 01<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but bot will always send packets even if doors are alredy opened and that might be detectable so better use that:<br />
