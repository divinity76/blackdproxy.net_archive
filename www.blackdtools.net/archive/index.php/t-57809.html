<br />
Anyways I have set OPTIONAL in the id field because I am aware I was losing customers because that stupid thing. You are not the first one to point it.<br />
<br />
Anyways what my system is asking you there is your national identification number or company VAT ID, for tax saving purposes.<br />
<br />
I think every european web is legally forced to request some info for the invoice, because we should make an invoice. For example, just take a look at Cipsoft payment system at tibia.com</div></div><hr />
