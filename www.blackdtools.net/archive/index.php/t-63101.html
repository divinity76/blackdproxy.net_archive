About  
Hello OTLand community, 
 
For more than a year now i've been trying to search for the right person to get a RealOTS running that is completely meant for the community and will be based on feedback and suggestions from the players. This is a pure copy of the original game, as it was 2005. No changes have been made yet and the server is currently running on a dedicated server in Canada. I live in The Netherlands and I gotta say, there's almost no lag" />

Hello OTLand community,<br />
<br />
For more than a year now i've been trying to search for the right person to get a RealOTS running that is completely meant for the community and will be based on feedback and suggestions from the players. This is a pure copy of the original game, as it was 2005. No changes have been made yet and the server is currently running on a dedicated server in Canada. I live in The Netherlands and I gotta say, there's almost no lag We would like to ask you for your opinion on what can be changed or what do you want to see changed? This can vary from rates until items. Players who have played RealOTS in the past know that there were changes for Knights and Paladins in order to make it more balanced. Is that something that you'd like to be added here aswell? For more information, keep on reading the post and feel free to reply with your opinion.<br />

Server Information<br />
• Hosting Company: OVH.com<br />
• This is supposed to be a long-term server, hence the low-rates.<br />
• Like in the previous RealOTS, there will be premium roses at a cheaper cost. The rose will only cost 4 dollars and will add 30 premium days.<br />
• Everyone will start with 14 days of premium<br />
• Even though we are limited with edits, we are still able to add the following;<br />
- Custom Sprites<br />
- Custom story lines<br />
- Custom areas with spawns, houses<br />
- Quests<br />
- Items<br />
<br />
The server will go live within 2 weeks<br />
<br />
&#9644;<br />
With all that being said, we would like to hear your opinions. Do you think the premium rose will ruin the player base on the server? Give us your opinion on what could replace the premium rose<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
BoneZ</div></div><hr />
