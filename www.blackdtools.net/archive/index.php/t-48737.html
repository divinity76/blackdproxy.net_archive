<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dazza</div><div class="date">02-21-2010, 19:12</div></div><div class="posttext">why would they port scan me tho this has not happened to me before? and the ip isnt the server i play its a leads to a website called ThePlanet.com Internet Services. which are connected to cipsoft. there using there service for sumthing. this has nothing to do with the server i play im pretty sure of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pater</div><div class="date">02-21-2010, 21:24</div></div><div class="posttext">ThePlanet.com is hosting service company for dedicated servers so it is not something strange that it redirects you to its main page. CipSoft  leases server from them but i dont know for what ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dazza</div><div class="date">02-22-2010, 01:38</div></div><div class="posttext">well for now im going to assume it has sumthing to do with the ban waves.need the person who made the bot or a programmer who knows about this stuff 2 reply. do these bots use certain ports? is that how they detect you. if a port isnt suppose 2 be open and wen they can it is that wud be a 100% reason to say sum1 used the bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">02-22-2010, 18:40</div></div><div class="posttext">If your firewall catch that ip adress up.. you can probably see what ports are used ;p</div></div><hr />

blackd proxy used certain ports 16xxx AFAIR, but this is no reason to justify a ban, since any program can be using them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dazza</div><div class="date">02-22-2010, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">ye it did tell me the ports scanned..i didnt have it set to save logs tho. cip using them to host sumthing tho and scan my ports seems a bit fishy if u ask me..what other reason would they do this? ive never been banned and i use blackd.elf.ng have been since they were released and never had a ban yet..</div></div><hr />
