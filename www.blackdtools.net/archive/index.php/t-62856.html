I'm having some problem with BlackdProxy to log in to OTServers. I'm getting Error:Network Error.(-1), til here it's ok cause with some insistence it logs.  
 
The problem is that when logged in I can't use any Proxy's functions. Seems like it doesn't recognize characters, so I can't use anything. 
 
Last weeks I was using 10.82 version, that was working everything alright. 
 
Any help? Any suggestion? I tried to use IP changer, no results." />
