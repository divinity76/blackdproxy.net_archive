<br />
I've made some events that allow some basic moves. I will add more commands as soon as I can. Make your requests about a command you want to be added and I'll see if it's possible to make.<br />
<br />
Load this event in the slave's event window (not conditional events!!)<br />
and use the following commands to control him.<br />
<br />
!up - move up<br />
!down - move down<br />
!right - move right<br />
!left - move left<br />
!faceup - makes slave face upwards<br />
!facedown - make slave face downwards<br />
!faceright - make slave face right<br />
!faceleft - make slave face left<br />
!follow - Makes slave follow the master.<br />
Note about follow: Slave won't see the green square surrounding the master that indicate following, but still it will go after the master. This type of following (packet based) do not get canceled whenever the slave moves to another direction. Slave must hit escape key or get a stop command from the master.<br />
!stop - Makes slave stop attack or follow.<br />

<br />
for that, open the txt file in notepad and add this at the end:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1<br />
0000100000000000000:0<br />
!vis<br />
exori vis<br />
<br />
<br />
The mage will say exori vis whenever you msg him with &quot;!vis&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok I'll give you an example of the script usage.<br />
Open 2 mcs.<br />
MC1 will be a char named John and MC2 will be a char named Peter.<br />
Open your Events windows on John and load the master/slave.txt.<br />
Now go to Peter's MC, open a private char with John and tell him &quot;!up&quot; (without the quotes). <br />
You will see how John moves upwards at your command.<br />
<br />
This is what the script is for, controlling chars using text commands.<br />
<br />
To use it, save the code to a txt file. And put it in your events folder, which is inside blackd proxy folder. Now go to events window on your proxy and hit Reload. Then select the master/slave.txt from the drop down box or whatever you named the file. Then hit LOAD, and you're done :)</div></div><hr />

So that's usefull to hunt with mc's, isn't it? If it is it would be very nice :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weeper</div><div class="date">05-05-2007, 03:43</div></div><div class="posttext">My personal recommendation is to set YOUR OWN CUSTOM commands. These were just to give you an idea.<br />
Maybe use change the &quot;!&quot; sign to something else. Or use commands in another language.<br />
Example. <br />
#arriba<br />
#abajo<br />
<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fry</div><div class="date">05-08-2007, 12:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Please note that anybody will be able to control the slave. If they know command keys. So it's better to redesign them to something more impossible to &quot;know&quot;.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, anybody selling &quot;!up&quot; will make the char walking up, wich would be sooo lame</div></div><hr />

I guess this tutorial made by weeper himself could be useful, making it check if the sender was your char and then check the message.<br />
Since i dont have blackd proxy yet i cant try anything lol</div></div><hr />

Doesnt this go only to blackd proxy? I think it doesnt go to tibia server, like exiva exp and stuffs~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, you could do that check for $lastsender$ and $lastmsg$, if both are true then respond to master's commands.<br />
<br />
<br />

It actually goes to tibia serv. It's like a normal private message. When the slave detects that msg he acts as he's programmed to.</div></div><hr />

thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
