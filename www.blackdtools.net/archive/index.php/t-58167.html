Only level -3 waypoints, will add level -4 waypoints once my knight is good enough<br />

So far it's working great man ! Thanks so much !<br />
Yeah I'm excited for when you update it to -4, but gotta watch out for ghosts who are resistant to physical bro... ?!<br />
Goodluck.</div></div><hr />

Hey man, thanks for the reply, just with the ghosts, i was under the belief that they only started spawning at lvl -5? at least that's what is said on tibiawiki although i could be incorrect. I'll have to be adventurous soon and find out for myself but at the moment it seems like a fair effort to go down there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, sorry I thought you meant -4 from inside the cave! <br />
Anyway, yeah I've been using this script and it's working great! <br />
And -4 will have no ghosts! So it will work out well! <br />
<br />
Right now the exp/h is 13k/h, but with another level down it will move to around 20k+/h... So please update it as soon as possible, hope your knight is taking some levels bro!<br />
<br />
The script works very well for me, i'll be looking for your other scripts in the future man... Sadly I can't code ;(<br />
<br />
Thanks again brother.<br />

Hey man, you can make scripts easily if you want to. it was fairly straight forward, just never actually made the depositor, just stole it off a script for venore rotworms and modified it to work for the undeads. currently my knight has so little stamina that it doesn't receive loot and only 50% exp so i've made a new char on that account. i ventured down the level below yesterday but couldn't make profit from the level because of the crypt shamblers hitting too hard, i might make the script then train up to be able to kill them easily.<br />
I'll hopefully be putting the script for the next level up by about tuesday or wednesday if all goes well, but may be able to do it sooner if i put my mind to it.<br />
<br />
Just a quick question, with the level below, would you want it to alternate from 3rd level to fourth or just stay on the fourth? Once I've figured that out it may only be a matter of hours before I can update it. Thanks for the reply, i hope to hear from you soon.</div></div><hr />
