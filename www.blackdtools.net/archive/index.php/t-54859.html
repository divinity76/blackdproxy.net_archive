<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-01-2011, 19:43</div></div><div class="posttext">if you didn't receive your gold you should contact me by email with your order number.<br />
 <br />
- if the logs displays that we forgot to sent the gold then we will send it asap.<br />
 <br />
- if the logs of your order displays how we sent gold to your char then that is not our problem.<br />
 <br />
And in any case you should know we don't hack anyone. That is just a stupid idea. Who would risk a big business for hacking gold worth 28 euros?<br />
 <br />
In case we tell you that we sent the gold, then, if you share account you should consider as main theory that one of your friends probably hacked you.</div></div><hr />
