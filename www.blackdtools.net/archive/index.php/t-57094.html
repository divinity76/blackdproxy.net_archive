<br />
Anyways I must say that I made new chars and I caveboted 2 hours with each of them using version 22.2 and none of them was deleted, so that is a good signal.<br />
<br />
I also must say that I will ignore deletion reports from unknown persons because some persons might be here only to damage the reputation of this bot. I only will consider the deletion reports of mods and users with well known good reputation who made new accounts since 22.2<br />
<br />
For now I can't know that it is safe or not. However after the survival status of this first testing stage I think it is very probably safe and that is what I told to some of my rl friends who will start botting on high level chars for the second stage of my internal safety tests.<br />
<br />
Note for the users: I won't give any safety guarantee about my free bots. There will be never any kind of compensation for deletion. I only will state my opinions about the current status about autodetection.<br />
<br />
Current status of Blackd Proxy: All my test accounts created after version 22.2 survived to 1 ban wave. Anyways we have discovered some problems that needs to be fixed.<br />
Current status of Blackd Safe Cheats: There are still zero reports of deletion from people who only used this small pack of cheats. I think this one is 100% safe as always.</div></div><hr />

- we are going to delete the command retryAttacks in the next version. Retry-attack mode is disabled by default in current version, however it can lead to a autodetection if your script enables that mode through that command.<br />
- we are going to improve the cavebot attack. Blackd Proxy needs to handle the server stop attack event. It happens rarely but it needs to be handled correctly. Else maybe there is some risk of autodetection because this thing.<br />

I will try to release a new version in 2-3 days</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to BOT 3 accounts, and leveled a 4th one by hand.<br />
<br />
The account i used to level up by hand, used the cavebot tool to loot gold from dead mobs.<br />
<br />
The other 3 accounts, i used to BOT 24/7.<br />
<br />
At the end, the account i used to level up by hand, but using the loot gold function from cavebot got banned, the others i used the entire cavebot function, didnt, lol.</div></div><hr />

that's scary. However, was that Before version 22.2?<br />
<br />
because indeed, using the wrong tibia.dat, the cavebot would send the wrong &quot;open corpse ID blabla&quot;; defiantly detectable by cipsoft. and cipsoft secretly updates the tibia.dat from time to time. version 22.2 makes sure to always use the same tibia.dat the client uses. (thus, it wont mess up the IDs any more than the real tibia client. but thats Only version 22.2++)</div></div><hr />

Yep, i just upgrade to 22.2 2 days before i got banned, so, i think i was detected while still using the old version, i just through it was strange cause the accounts i really used to bot, wasnt banned, but the one i just used to loot, got deleted =P</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your post. Yes, that was a potential problem too.<br />
I can confirm you that such thing is already fixed in the new version 22.3. Blackd Proxy will remove such subpackets in a very smart way. Anyways I still need to fix some other things before the release of 22.3. Please be patient.</div></div><hr />
