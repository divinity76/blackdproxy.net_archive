<br />
My Exori strike conditionals work perfectly with wands and rods. They don't waste mana casting the spell when monster is already dead. You can kill the monster with one shot of wand and one exori, which was impossible with SetSpellKill function.<br />
<br />
ATTENTION: It works only if you delete SetSpellKill commands for the same monsters you want to kill with conditional Exori.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cavebot SetSpellKill spams Exori Vis like crazy and your mage doesn't shoot with wand/rod and it casts 1 more spell when monster is already dead. If you kill your monsters with 1-2 Exori, THIS WILL SAVE YOU 20-40% OF THE HUNTING COST <br />
<br />
You stop casting Exori when the monster is below X hp. This way you will finish them off with your wand and NEVER waste a spell again. <br />
<br />
You can optimize the amount of Exori Vis/Frigo/Terra/Mort you use on the monsters. You can kill monsters with 1 wand shot and 1 Exori, or 2 wand shots and 1 Exori. This is extremely cheaper than traditional SetSpellKill. <br />
<br />
The RED VALUE is the %hp below which you want to stop casting Exori spell. Change it depending on the strength of your wand and monster's hp.<br />
<br />
The Blue Text is the spell you want to attack the monsters with.<br />
<br />
The Green Text are names of monsters you want to attack with exori. You can copy this line as many times as needed, changing just the names of monsters.<br />

Enjoy the script and give me some feedback! I really have a feeling that I created something breakthrough here. In the future I might optimize it with more variables.<br />
<br />
If you want to attack  different monsters with different exori spell, just create the next set of conditionals next to the first one, with different names and different _var name, for example change _var into _var1<br />
<br />
<br />

ye I did, I wanted this for pirates in nargor, but doesn't work, tried 10000 times already, I need it but it doesn't work for me. Can you try to make one for pirate ghost, pirate skeleton, ghoul, tarantula and slime? I'll be very thankful</div></div><hr />

Ok first off just a rant <br />
Alien, you dont NEED this, im sure you managed to hunt just fine up to this point and will hunt just fine with or without this script. And you say you tried it 10000 times, I would honestly be surprised if you tried it more than 4 times. So if i were you, i would be kissing Colorion's feet and posting your edited condition and asking him if he would please tell you where you went wrong. <br />
<br />
@Colorion<br />
thanks for the script,<br />
can i set it to work with all monsters like the long exori condition? after editing the max cond value ofc</div></div><hr />

Lol :P you got some imagination running dude :p:p <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if it wouldn't cause delay. If not, go for it! So much more convenient to have one cond for all. Also, if you were nice enough to publish it, I'd be grateful.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the pirate script, IMO you're just looking for someone external to blame. If this still doesn't work, you can say that MY script doesn't work, not YOUR edit of my script. Anyways, here it is and keep in mind that you need to attack with wand/rod too, else it just doesn't work.<br />

yes I need this,because I am wasting much everytime I go here, and this cond would help me much, + I asked him to make one for pirates and then I wrote &quot;I will be very thankful&quot;, my english isn't best maybe, tho it seems you can't read.<br />
<br />
and @Colorion, thanks for changing I'll try later today or tommorow, and ye I tried it with wand ofc. And no, it's not like I am looking someone to blame, I just find the cond useful, I changed it myself and it just didn't work so I asked if you can make one for me with pirates, but the cond I changed is  the same as the one you just wrote for me, but I'll still check it</div></div><hr />
