<br />
Here's a easy script for Venore Swamp Trolls. This is made for paladins but can be used by others.<br />
<br />
Borrowed a couple of things from Malmis script, even some things that does not do anything in mine. Thanks Malmis ur a great scripter.<br />
<br />
I made this because i wanted to deposit Medicine pouches, which Malmis didn't do. But also because i needed to leave every couple of hours to get new spears from DP which i couldn't figure out how to put in to malmis a alot more complicated script. And i got stuck in Malmis script trying to enter a house which i was not invited in to. Probably something weird that only happend to me but well, well. This is more favorable for a paladin who can Exura through the slugs, maybe using a health potion now and then.<br />
<br />
It goes to the swamp troll cave, and down to slugs, when you are low on cap or spears it goes back to dp and deposites everything except gold which it puts in the bank. If you dont use spears, put a # infront of this line dont remove it:<br />
<br />
<br />
IfFewItemsGoto CD 0C,5,319<br />
<br />
otherwise it wont work. Dont remove any line or it wont work.<br />
<br />
At the moment it leves at less than 5 spears or less than 40 cap. This can be configured here:<br />
<br />
<br />
IfFewItemsGoto CD 0C,-----&gt;5&lt;------,319<br />
IfTrue ($mycap$#number&gt;=#-----&gt;40&lt;----- Goto 174<br />
<br />
It doesnt buy potions, this is my first script and im no good so far. Will put all my scripts here as i get better!<br />
<br />
Start in Venore East Depot<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For 1st time users like me a couple of days ago:<br />
<br />
Auto pickup spears: Use Trainer, activate left hand and put a number of spears that leaves some of ur cap for medicine pouches. Change the global timer to 100 ms - 400 ms or it wont pick up cause its too slow.<br />
<br />
Auto Heal: Mana and HP. Put settings for exura when u lose a bit of health and Potion when u go below 45%<br />
<br />
Rune Maker: Activate auto eat. Activate &quot;cast spell when your out of runes/soul points&quot;. Set spell to : exura and mana cost: your maximum mana - 5 mana points.<br />
<br />
Depot: Put spears in stacks of 3 or 4 in ur Depot, dont stack all, so it can refill ur spears.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggested level:<br />
<br />
none, but you need at least about 180 Hp to do well with the slugs.<br />
<br />
Bring:<br />
<br />
Health Potions x 20, will last for a night for my lvl 18 pala<br />
Rope<br />
Shovel<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy it!<br />
