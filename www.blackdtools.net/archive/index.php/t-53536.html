Uhm it all seems kinda weird, didn't he say on your middleman service thread that his partnership with you had ended because you scammed someone using your service?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Lol? xDD Ernie scammed Pinjooo that's why he got banned here, I don't remember what happened with Rillish but he scammed someone as well, can you give me a link where Ernie said I scammed him or something? cause he didnt get scammed, it was my friend Pinjooo, who was sharing acc with Ernie :)<br />
<br />
And don't be so pathethic cause you know how much you have lied in this forum, first pretending to be a girl to 'make friends?' then making multiple accs claiming with them that 'raoul' was trustworthy, or creating threads asking if you are trusty, then pretended to buy an acc from you for 300 euros and then when I caught you having the same ip as this acc, you said it was your rl brother. (asking people if you are trusty or not right? xDDD)</div></div><hr />

And latest msg on Lexxis123 message board is &quot;you have that guy running Ofwat scam ..?<br />
because this is bad for my reputation .. kk&quot; Tranlated it to english. And now they ip matches? First of all, you should never share youre forum accounts, especially not peoples you don't trust enought to backup when they are accused for scamming.<br />
Some times you don't have to have solid proof to see that someone is scamming and have been scamming. As i see it right now you helped lexxis rip of peoples, then accused him as he's rep wasn't as good as urs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexxis123</div><div class="date">12-07-2010, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I created that acc for raoul since he hasked me for it why else would i make the acc called Imgay and check what the password is and find out its my realname<br />
<br />
and i never ripped people of on this forum<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Imgay</div><div class="date">12-08-2010, 00:34</div></div><div class="posttext">All bullshit, i am banned on raoul and when i log out and try to register a new account my forum acccount relogs, thats why lexxis made it, and i still dont got proof, i got a BIG feeling of pathetic accusing without proof, and you cant just ignore this, or i guess blackd will take punishment against u if u are faking this!and i have never helped lexxis scamming, and as far as i know lexxis GOT scammed by fhs_D_D or something, so quit this crap you cant ban anyone without a proof, READ THE RULES. you dissapoint me so fucking hard Razoor, always toucht you where one of the good guys around the forum. but well guess i was wrong, but im worring, since karma is a bitch and will bite you back also..<br />
<br />
o btw if you give me the proof and it is true i will make sure and i mean for real, that ill never ever come back, and aslong as the proof is even true i wont belief any of this blackmaking shit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlzNoKil</div><div class="date">12-08-2010, 09:34</div></div><div class="posttext">So Razoor is a bad person for baning ppl?<br />
he banned people before, you never thought he was a bad person until it came to your self, for something you did 2008(???)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-08-2010, 11:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, he got banned for something he did on 2008 because back them he escaped. There were some kind of misunderstanding's back then or he had good friends as moderators. Just like in real life, you can be arrested for something you did 1, 5 or even 15 years ago. Time is not an excuse for being unpunished.<br />
<br />
To whom Raoul is right now, do not pretend not to remember. Make some affords and think about all the things you have done. By the way, I've seen those proofs plus I remember those situations. Even though my account came after, I used to visit these forums frequently. You can got and cry to Blackd, however your word is worthless to him compared to Razoor's one lol.  From me, you will get no proofs, that's up to Razoor to decide.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
We were friends on tibia? Wow i had no ide about that.. All i can remeber is you lying about having a 130+ ek on thoria wish you hadn't, you told me you was emoclew later i fought on the same side as him and guess what he was polish and had owned the character for a long time and you told me ur friends sold it afew weeks ago.. Then you playd the same ot as me thats it and only reason i even spoke to you was becuse you hooked me up with task script wish i found out later was free on elfs forum.. so no we was never friends.. And why would anyone belive you ? ur probly the biggest lier around this forums ever</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well thinking about how many times you have been accused with lack of proofs you should be honored that ur not banned to.. If anyother mod or blackd himself wanted proof i would be happy to supply them, but i don't have any reason to show some random friend of the guilty one the proofs.</div></div><hr />
