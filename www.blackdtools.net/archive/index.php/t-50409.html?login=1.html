	<meta name="description" content="Hello ya all. After some retirement I decided to get on some fast rates ots. I came in with 2 friends and while we got 150 lvls, couple BR's started attacking us. As a result, one of them, 200+ rp died and lost all eq xD.  
 
The server is kinda empty so you can pg as you just want to :P. 
 
Well we had alot of fun of them, and I would like to invite you to this server if you've got some spare time. 
 
I would try to make you easier start giving something, but loot rate on the ots is not that" />
