This is one of my major concerns since last year, I mean, Cipsoft is AWARE of this forum, and I fear that maybe a few of the forum 'members' are actually spies from cip.. <br />
anyways as I said many times before:<br />
Daniel, you are doing a really great job, as you always keep your custumers updated with everything, and I have never ever regretted chosing blackd. but sometimes I think that in some aspects you need more confidentiality. I mean, it really cheers me up everytime I read your updates, but I think you should maintain some kind of information secret, so that cip would be a bit more 'lost' in their anticheat development. Cipsoft never releases info about their detection mechanism, and I think you must also keep them secret ;)<br />
<br />
Conclusion: It's great to let us know what are you working on, but please don't reveal &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; are you doing it!!!<br />

isnt starting the virtual clicks bot already a better choice?<br />
cip said on a interview some time ago to be planning to making the &quot;flash client&quot;, maybe it would afect your packet captation/sending?<br />
<br />
in my noob opinion, a virtual click bot is completely safe, even tho cip isnt very nice, i belive they tell the truth when saying they always only ban with 100% certain of cheating, and, i think a virtual clicks bot is at least safer since there are many interpretations of the source of a virtual click, that makes it impossible to determine if it was cheating or not, also tibia works in all windows and linux, which i think would be even harder to determine a virtual click as cheat in all systems and all software set a computer can have... <br />
<br />
also, i have never heard of a virtual click bot, except the simple funcions one(noob scripts) i made with a (more complex than usual)tasker.<br />
<br />
virtual click is the future for botting tibia... sooner or later it will be only one possible, since cip could have changed or complicated their packtet sending to avoid bots long time ago<br />
<br />
sooner or later it will be the only botting way, why then not starting it right now? i know packtet sending is way much simpler and easier, and much work was done so far, but i think you should start virtual clicks bot right now! xD<br />
<br />
with this complicated task i guess you will need a big study in tibia gameplay, but this community seems to be very dedicated to help, so am I.<br />
<br />
PS....<br />
blackd... has that monstruous tool, that even you could improve it if havnet done yet, the 0fps, which allowed me to play many many mcs, if i had a lan house, id buy all pcs an blackd key, and according to my noob calculations, id make 4kk tibian gold daily with today's balckd proxy, but if it had many many improvments, it could be far much more<br />
<br />
i wouldnt like to be without bot, and your bot helps many people, but if i were you, id take my time in a project to bot gold yourself, for selling in your website, because soon, very soon cipsoft will make what other games made, i belive cip will imprement a tool, to detect and track tibia gold making big ammounts of gold investigable, and punishing its owner<br />
ive read in the forums people talking about a program to login, and send simple packtes commands to tibia servers, without the original client, maybe it would be possible to play far much more &quot;mcs&quot; bots at same time, todays tibia packet protocols allows it<br />
<br />
damm ive wrriten so much... too much shit i talk &gt;.&gt; sry<br />
<br />
anyways, good luck daniel, i like you cos of the way u talk in forums<br />

oh well... I guess you're right lol<br />
<br />
but maybe they are too lazy to disassemble ng/elf/TA/blackd/mage?<br />
XD lets hope so<br />
<br />
<br />
or maybe they already did they are just playing around banning randomly</div></div><hr />

Sorry for opening another post but something just came to my mind. Tasker is a REALLY simle task(lol) repeating macro.<br />
I used it back in the old days to login to tibia (if you are from the old days, you would know why - no login waitlist, instead, you have to try again and again when the server is full).<br />
<br />
But this reminded me of SCAR (Shite Compared to Auto Rune), a runescape macro based on some programming (much more usefull/complex than tasker) <br />
It has a hell loads of functions, and I was just wondering, if it's possible to make a &quot;cavebot&quot; using SCAR? I have used it to minimize bps before after serversave login and made other simple 'conds' like autologout, eating meat, runemaking, fishing etc. <br />
well my point is that this runescape macro withstood the test of time - being a standalone bot that survived all runescape updates (yes I know runescape / Jagex sucks but this is just and idea).<br />
<br />
what do you guys think about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shanera</div><div class="date">05-18-2010, 17:28</div></div><div class="posttext">in todays tibia anything you can do can be done with tasker...<br />
im trying to start back with tibia, i have many plans, but few knoledge and will, if i didnt wake up amost at ss, i would make a tasker to login and put bot on after ss, i already have a noob tasker with basic funcions, drag 1 item at sqm mouse is(to antipush+items trashing), player menu comands(f+clik = openmenu+follow) (m+click = pvm) (p click = partyinvitedordisband), dragging to backpack, DEL END PGDW buttons to F(f1,f2 etc) hotkeys utani gran hur, MW(f9) and SF rune(f12) , BS+0 = exiva xray0, BS++ = exiva xray(lastfloor+1), BS+- = exiva xray(lastfloor-1),  and other utilites outside tibia i made with tasker<br />
for exemple o couldnt make a MagWll hotkey to END button with blackd hotkeys, because it cant press a hotkey from tibia, but i make Lshift+arrow a hex of dashing, it helps alot, to use mouse and only the buttons around the arrows with a single hand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shanera</div><div class="date">05-18-2010, 17:31</div></div><div class="posttext">but as soon as u make cavebot with tasker will be implemented anti tasker things to game, just like runescape, ive played it for a little time, and i used to minning alot, and sometimes, the pick broke and was randonly trown away in a randon place around u, and u had to pick its piece and fix to continue mining, tibia will have similar things when tasker bot come</div></div><hr />
