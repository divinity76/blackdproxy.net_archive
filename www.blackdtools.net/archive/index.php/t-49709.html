Will it show that the owner of the account has requested a new recovery key and its being send via mail?<br />
<br />
If you are purchasing an account and you have a confirmation key it means nothing as you have 30 days for registration when the seller can get a new confirmation key.<br />
<br />
On the account you cant see if it has been ordered but if your seller is only giving you his word that he has ordered it you are better waiting until he finally has it and it will take a week to a couple of weeks to arrive depending on where you live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, until you activate your new one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes but even if you activate the new one it means the old one wont work but if the seller has bought two even activating it wont do much as he can just use his other confirmation code and your rec key wont work and only his will.</div></div><hr />
