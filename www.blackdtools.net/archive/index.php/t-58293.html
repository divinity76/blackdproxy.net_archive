If you are reading this forum then your CPU is good enough for Blackd Proxy! What is the problem then? <br />
Possible problem 1 = You are running Tibia at max frames per second -&gt; no cpu left for Blackd Proxy<br />
Possible problem 2 = You are running too many Tibia clients -&gt; no cpu left for Blackd Proxy<br />
<br />
THE SOLUTION:<br />
- Decrease Tibia framerate in Options &gt; Graphics &gt; Advanced &gt; Adjust framerate limit &gt; set 25 or less. Ensure that the displayed framerate counter keeps stable there. If it is not stable then decrease it even more. You might need to do that in all your multiclients. More multiclients = you should set less framerate limit in all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tibia client wastes 100% cpu if framerate is not limited.<br />
by default it is not limited</div></div><hr />

by default it is not limited<br />
<br />
But with max I only get like 30 fps haha, does it still suck further CPU even if its not gaining any more frames?<br />
<br />
Guess thats a stupid question... *goes to test it*<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
HOLY FUCKING SHIT! Limited it to 50fps and its now only using 50% CPU. Fantastic stuff! Thanks alot haha<br />
<br />
Second edit:<br />
<br />
I do believe the lifespan of this computer is now longer since it doesnt have to run its fan at full speed CONSTANTLY :D</div></div><hr />
