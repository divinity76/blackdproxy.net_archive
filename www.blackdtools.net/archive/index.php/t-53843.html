<br />
@Edit:<br />
BlackD tools provide you basic healings, x-ray and light that cannot be detected by cipsoft. Its called BlackD Safe Cheats and the license for this software is also included on your BlackD Proxy Software ^^<br />
Another useful tool is BlackD Hotkeys which provides you with eat food and anti-idle options. Also undetectable.</div></div><hr />
