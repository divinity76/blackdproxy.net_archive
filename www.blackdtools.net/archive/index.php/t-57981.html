<br />
In April, many players repeatedly experienced connection problems such as mass kicks which were caused by heavy DDoS attacks. Since the start of these attacks, we have worked on getting the situation under control again by initiating various countermeasures.<br />
<br />
As a temporary measure to alleviate the negative ingame impact of these attacks, we have made all blessings available for free, as we mentioned in a news at the end of April. We have carefully monitored our servers since then. The combination of countermeasures we have taken proved to be quite effective. Therefore, the free blessings option will be taken out of the game on Thursday, May 10, server save.<br />
<br />
In addition, we also asked you for suggestions concerning ways of making further amends for the loss of fun you had to deal with. Thanks a lot of the constructive feedback you have given on this matter! Since many players pointed out that especially the skill loss hurts a lot, we have come up with the following combination:<br />
Between the server saves of May 10 and May 17, all monsters will yield twice the usual amount of experience points, and your skill training, including magic level, will advance twice as fast! Having the choice between gaining twice as much experience points and double skill training should also ease the hunting situation a bit which some players were concerned about in case of a double experience week.<br />
<br />
We especially like the idea of assigning a pool of bonus experience points and skill training to a character which only gets used up while playing. However, developing and implementing such a feature would require considerable time so it cannot be done quickly. Still, we consider it a promising approach for the future.<br />
<br />
We would like to thank you all again for your patience and the confidence you have shown us during these difficult times.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />
