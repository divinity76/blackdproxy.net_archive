I'm rather intricate with everything I do so things have to be rather perfect. I searched the forums here for quite a while browsing other scripts. I even tried writing one my self and would do so only If I could figure out how to make the character go down stairs or a ladder. Ahaha.<br />
<br />
Anywho, this should be simple. North thais troll script? Should include auto depositer to bank / run to thais temple if under attack / Auto eat food? And ofcourse kill all the creatures one might encounter at north thais trolls. Snakes and what not.<br />
<br />
Also, is there a way to make a character cast a spell when their mana is full? I hate seeing my mages walk around above 70%health, with full mana... Thanks for any help in advance, if all works out well I can make a donation to paypal and would most likely require your services again.  Thanks again, in advance.<br />
<br />
Kind regards, ~~Reki</div></div><hr />

You mean the ones in ancient temple or somewhere else?<br />
<br />
The max mana I got one... Either just copy this to a .txt file in your conds folders:<br />
<br />
$mymanapercent$<br />
#number=#<br />
100<br />
0<br />
1000<br />
0<br />
exura<br />
or take a look at this, which will make sure you never waste the 1 mana you might sometimes regenerate... :p<br />

I stumbled across the mana training thing last night on my own before I checked forum today. xD Thanks regardless. Ill give some looking into how to get go updown/ladders. Does this still include if there is a shovel point where the character needs to use a shovel? <br />
<br />
I was referring to the trolls above the smaller cyclops spawn in thais.  Mount sternum would be far east of this location. There are 2 snakes as you go down the first step mixed with a few trolls and other things. I went ahead and set waypoints last night but manually deposited.  Is there something I can do, to make the character open additional backbacks to put gold in? It seems as if when the first backpack is full of gold, I have another in my main backpack, or even if I manually open the new backpack in a second window, he only attempts to place gold into the first backpack even if he has spare cap.<br />
<br />
Thanks for anyhelp in advance. This is byfar my favorite program I've used yet. Ng, ghost,to Neo. I like BlackD. It's the overlord of client modifiers.<br />
<br />
Kind regards, Reki~~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malmis</div><div class="date">03-13-2012, 16:08</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as you have some kind of rope or shovel the bot will automatically find it's way. Easiest way is to put a waypoint before and one after the level change, as in one adjecent to the hole and one at the rope spot.<br />
But at most spawns where a creep spawns right under the hole the bot will kill all creeps in sight and then move back to the rope spot position before continuing at that level, looking very bot-like. One thing that might work is to put the waypoint a little bit in the direction you're heading efter changing level, just maybe 3-4 sqm and it doesn't look as bad. :p<br />
You need to have all lootbackpacks open before starting, but don't minimize them. Looks odd if you loot into minimized backpacks. :p<br />
Also to open tombs/larvas or pick holes you'll need to use custom hexes.<br />
I'll run over there soon and make a script.</div></div><hr />

This guy, is a hero. What servers do you play? , Also is it possible to make a character return to depo to deposit, even if his cap isnt full? Say, hes out of slots to place items or gold into, but the character still has additional cap.<br />
