Edron rots. : This script is fine for a knight fresh out of the isle with 25/20 skills and decent equips. I've been averaging around 13k/hr xp without 50% bonus and around 900g an hour in raw cash plus the vendorable creature products. Gold may be closer to 1500 an hour but since the speed in which the bot completes its route and checks to see if my gold is high enough to go deposit its hard for me to tell. I recommend the following equipment to start this script: Crown helmet or better, spike shield or better, leather boots, jagged sword or weapon equivalent of your choice, and plate armor/pants. For a knight starting out take at least 10 health pots with you though you will likely use no more than three before you are high enough on skills to not take any damage on full attack. Script will deposit gold in bank and loot in depot once every 3-4 circuits before heading back down to farm again.<br />
<br />
Ankrahmun Larvas/Scarabs West: This script works well for a druid of level 25+ with ML 20/25 Shielding and Exori Flam spell. This script will earn you about 18-20k/hr xp without 50% bonus and around 1600/hr gold plus vendorable creature products. You will want at least the following Equipment: Northwind Rod, and 50 Def worth of armor. Start the script with 20 mana potions for each hour of farm you want without having to check on it. This script is not very effecient for making cash, it will make you slight profit but it is mostly good for the xp, if you want to make more money off of it remove the lines from 101-169 and it will only farm using rod and should be potion-less. For script without 101-169 the same setup of gear should be more than enough and level can be adjusted to 18 instead of 25. script will deposit gold in bank and loot in depot once every 5-6 circuits before heading back down to farm again.<br />
<br />
I hope this is a good start. If you have locations you know are low population please feel free to send me locations and I can test them and write a script for them.</div></div><hr />
