30 days ago, I gifted him my account with the option to send me some money for it if he wishes to (see: http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?53804-WTS-lvl180-druid-%28-1.5kk%29-on-Antica)<br />
Over PM, he was like totally friendly and he was totally willing to send me the money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now after 30 days, I kindly asked if he is still willing to send the money. He could have simply said &quot;No&quot;, but instead invented a story about that the account was just hacked after 30 days, shortly before it was completely under his control. And of course he accuses me to be the &quot;hacker&quot;.<br />
<br />
Here is a question to people that have a bit brain in their head: why would I wait 30 days to get the account back? I could have done it anytime. And of course nobody would transfer me any money before having full control of the account.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
It doesn't bother me at all that the account is gone since it was a gift in the first place. What bothers me is that people sink to such a low level to make profit. He could have simply say &quot;No, I changed my mind.&quot;. Instead, he insults me with inventing this crap.<br />
<br />
@Colin: The day in your life will come where your attitude will bring you down. And it will cost you much more than this little account is worth it.</div></div><hr />
