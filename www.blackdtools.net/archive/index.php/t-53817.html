Believe, this always works simply because the few women who doesn't want to be ruled will never stay on a relationship, and the others will, so all you have to do is find those willing to be ruled...<br />
Never ever overvalue a woman, even her being your mom/grandma. You don't know what they did before you came...<br />
The rest comes easy then, and you'll hardly get disappointed/surprised.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Let her do her own thing then. You ignore her. They get more pissed off when you ignore them and act like you don't care :P<br />
<br />

<br />
Btw.. Women are from Venus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexxis123</div><div class="date">12-31-2010, 16:02</div></div><div class="posttext">but its not that i want her as my gurlfriend heh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">12-31-2010, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend this: She is behaving weirdly because its very awkward for her having cheated you and being near you. So you have two options: Either you act like you dont care and hope for the best, or you can break upwith her. You wnt be able to regain her confidence as friends that fast, but theres always time.<br />
<br />
People always forget time heals everything, and before you know it, both of you will be in talking terms again, and regain that friendship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexxis123</div><div class="date">12-31-2010, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Im going to pick for option one <br />
<br />
i had atleast one great night with her not many people can say that haha <br />
<br />
ps she is 4 years older XD and im 17</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">12-31-2010, 18:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, how fortunate you are. Two mods posting in your thread trying to give you advice! Hehehe<br />
<br />
Btw, I wouldn't act like I don't care, because if you care, you can never hide that feeling perfectly. This will make things change.<br />
I'd say you have two options: Forget her or talk to her and get things straight.<br />
If you forget her, it'll be like HavokD said, time will take care of things and sometime in the future you'll get closer again (or not)<br />
I'd go talk to her like a man you are.<br />
<br />
And by the way, remember this: Life always pass by, you can choose if you want to go with it, or stop at an obstacle and let life pass you by...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">12-31-2010, 19:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Just bear in mind that girls never like being affronted, so I think going to talk to her this soon may only put her in a defensive mood and screw things up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadow1</div><div class="date">12-31-2010, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">yeye bro like these 2 been sayin, i say give it time, i think would be best option if u still want to be with her or her friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexxis123</div><div class="date">01-01-2011, 15:01</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys helped me sort of out of this situation my feelings for her are already alot lower.<br />

So be careful what you wish for 'Cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold</div></div><hr />
