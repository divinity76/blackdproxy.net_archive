However with FastExiva you can perform an action and instantly proceed to execute the next line of the script, without waiting. 
  
This is mainly intended for doing operations with user variables without having little pauses in the script. A little basic example would be setting 3 variables at same time at start and instantly proceed to say something. Then later we see how the user variables could be used:

However with FastExiva you can perform an action and instantly proceed to execute the next line of the script, without waiting.<br />
 <br />
This is mainly intended for doing operations with user variables without having little pauses in the script. A little basic example would be setting 3 variables at same time at start and instantly proceed to say something. Then later we see how the user variables could be used:<br />
<br />
<br />
FastExiva _myfirstx=$myx$<br />
FastExiva _myfirsty=$myy$<br />
FastExiva _myfirstz=$myz$<br />
sayMessage something<br />
....<br />
move $_myfirstx$,$_myfirsty$,$_myfirstz$<br />
...<br />
<br />
 <br />
FastExiva can be also used to send packets without waiting for the result, like when you want to say something in trade channel:<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
....<br />
FastExiva &gt; 96 05 05 00 $hex-tibiastr:selling firesword 5k thais$<br />
move x,y,z<br />
...<br />
 <br />
This will say it and, instantly after that, it will start to move to x,y,z</div></div><hr />
