<br />
I won't be making new scripts until I can be assed to walk around on such a slow character.<br />
<br />
Anyway 8k in the bank. Only 1 PK related death. Going well.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to combat the &quot;RUN AROUND THE MONSTER AND AVOID ATTACKING IT UNTIL I WALK INTO A WALL&quot; mentality of blackdproxy? Still using auto-re-chase and follow ingame. But its so fucked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc221/Dreaded_Druid/Untitled-3.jpg<br />
<br />
Made over 30k. I transfered 20k off earlier incase of deletion :)<br />
<br />
I haven't made 10k quest yet. My server is dead so it probably won't be worth trying.</div></div><hr />

If you plan on buying a premium on a previous botted account, you should wait for the next massban to do so. Because until then you cannot be sure if your account has been caught or not.<br />
<br />
I won't explain how to do 10k quest here lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adri</div><div class="date">09-18-2012, 15:48</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello<br />

How i can know when will be next massban? them do it in 1 year or? xD<br />
<br />
Why u cant explain? :( i got many chars to do :@<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">09-19-2012, 02:06</div></div><div class="posttext">Next massban could be never. But I wouldn't waste money on a possibly deleted account. But that is just me.<br />
<br />
I won't explain how to do 10k quest because it is widely known and done daily for 10 years. If you can't follow the wiki I can't help you sorry.<br />

Send me a PM with your server and I'll mail you the script. Don't want people on my world hitting my spawn with my script! haha<br />
I also ask people not to release it publicly until I'm done with it (probably end of the month) I go to uni then so dno we'll see<br />
<br />
My Equip can be seen on a SS on page 1? I haven't changed. Brass set/serpent sword on both chars. haha<br />
<br />
Heres an update level 40 arrived!<br />

<br />
This one I have given to my higher level knight since there is possibility of getting lured to the Zerker. But I tried to avoid it. Testing it now, my second knight is hitting the first script ~ which is still rocking.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this second script is going to work because it isn't as much of a &quot;circle&quot; so respawn might fail.<br />
<br />
Anyway I've upgraded by weapons on both chars from Serpent swords to Crimson Swords. 2more atk. Might make a difference. Haha.<br />
<br />
What types of screenshots do people want to see? Because atm it is all just my exp gained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not happy with my Kaz Minotaur script. I have to give it food and it only takes 6.5k/h xp. Cash seems as fast as orcs though. I will remake a script soon which kills wolves for food aswell as the minos.<br />
<br />
I'm past 1000 minotaurs. So I think the nosering will come quick ;)<br />

are u making lootbags?<br />
i got like 150k gold in 1 week, not so much but for facc i guess it's ok<br />
also, how are u doing with minotaur archers?<br />
<br />
good luck<br />
<br />
No loot bag. Just doing creature produce. Doing like 2k/h cash (+ mino leathers). <br />
<br />
The archers are a pain, I made them priorty but having to provide the bot with food so it doesn't use potions.<br />
<br />

<br />
2.8k Minotaurs done.<br />
<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">09-29-2012, 21:42</div></div><div class="posttext">Plenty of people are sharing Kaz minos, which is fucking lame. Only making 4-5k/h xp. But only 1k minos to go.<br />

<br />
Transfered almost 75k off the orc botters. The NPC to sell creature produce is jsut above the spawn so I sell it on deposit. I'm not looting items like chain armors because cap will go too fast and I sometimes run 5h without deposit.<br />
<br />
Nose ring is only like 50k~100k, I'm hoping for a Dwarven helmet (also 50k) but I will probably keep these items. I think the Nose ring will boost the Minos loot to be equal with the Orc bot. which is nice. After I've finished the task I will find something new to bot. minotaurs is too far away.<br />
<br />
I took 55k off my Minobotter too<br />

<br />
I'm moving to university residence tomorrow. So I don't know if my internet will support tibia/ this project. So. Maybe goodbye? We will see!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">10-01-2012, 21:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Just saw this, Im quite Interested to know their levels and how long you been going ? Maybe Ill start up my FACCs again just for fun to have a race :) Last time I left them my main Bots were 74/73/68/62/58/56 Ish FACC Knights. Also, need prem to get the Nose ring? Never botted to complete tasks! Good luck in University Hells~ hopefully we see you around just as much! :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">10-02-2012, 00:43</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently I'm very busy, but tibia does run here. So I will probably continue these bots at somepoint.<br />
<br />
I believe they are level 47/37<br />
<br />
And that was in less than 30 days. Obviously stanima reduced the amount of time they could be playing.<br />
<br />
Yes: the nose ring task is for free accounts (located near Kaz). Need to be level 40- to accept the task. But once accepted you can kill the minotaurs at whatever level and face the fox. Probably a better idea to accept the task at 30 and start killing the minos at a higher level 40+ I had problems with the archers raping me! BlackD finds it almost impossible to kill a creature that runs away from you haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I avoided all the banwaves between when i went to university and now :) But I wasn't botting during those time.<br />
<br />
So level 37:<br />
http://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc221/Dreaded_Druid/Untitled-9_zps6d015ae0.jpg<br />
<br />
I think my chars are fully blessed from free bless times too.. not sure tho xD<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Loving the increased respawn rate:<br />
<br />
http://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc221/Dreaded_Druid/Untitled-9_zpsc27beab3.jpg<br />
<br />
Not bad no PKs or other bots today</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Patrick</div><div class="date">03-20-2013, 07:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice project! I also have 2 knight running now.

<br />
And 14k/h exp with the new spawn rate.<br />
<br />
Edit: Someone PKed me - some 100+, anyway 3k TWIST wasted. But after I spoke with the kid for abit he ended up giving me 30k cash + 70k items. So +100k from being pked... LOL<br />
<br />
smashing exp! Level 40: <br />

I transfer it all off incase of deletion. The 100k from the PK instantly got passed across to my main account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yesterday I made 21k, but depends how long I bot.<br />
<br />
I make around 2-2.5k/h and at the moment I'm botting 8-12 hours a day.<br />
<br />
I only run 1 knight at a time. I can't be fucked making another script and I need more than 1 knight because stanima drains with how I run them at the moment.<br />
<br />
Running my level 48 knight again today while the other knights regains stanima!</div></div><hr />

Trying to think of new places to bot. Since one of my characters is consistently making 5k/h less than the other exp wise, I wouldn't mind moving one to a slightly better area. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? - Mt sternum undeads is probably the best bet, but the food shortage there can be really annoying.<br />

Freddie I can't really help at level 9. Once you reach 35~ msg me and I will share my scripts.<br />
<br />
At 9 you can pretty much use north thais trolls or the wolf/bear addon collector script. Both are slow and shitty and found on these forums.<br />
<br />
Lith I hope you still check back here once in awhile. I will PM you at the start of Summer to see what you are up to, I will have some free time.<br />

I dont know how it would look with the increased spawn rate, but I highly recommend you switch to using a shield instead of a two-hander, as it will greatly decrease your loss of mana potions.
