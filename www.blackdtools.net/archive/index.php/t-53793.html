	<meta name="description" content="Greetings dear gold buyers and seller community, 
 
I would like to admit you that: 
- Setting up a moneybookers account takes up to 10minutes. 
- The commission is 1% of ur actual trade amount but no more than 0,50€. 
- You can not chargeback 
- Moneybookers blocks random account without PROPER reason way rarely than PayPal 
- You can fast and easy upload/withdraw funds on your account. 
 
The only minus is that you have to pay about 1,5€ every time you want to withdraw your money to your bank" />

The only minus is that you have to pay about 1,5€ every time you want to withdraw your money to your bank account, but I think that 1.5€ is not much cost if we're considering using something that doesn't allow to chargeback!<br />
<br />
MoneyBooker is safe, I just want to convince all of you to creating your own account! <br />
<br />
just simple because i can't understand why so many peoples yell on my service that I actually do not accept paypal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucash</div><div class="date">12-28-2010, 20:26</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know in this case you'll need to call MoneyBookers and solve your case INDIVIDUALLY.<br />
It is not so easy as 'open a dispute' button that in 99% causes succesfull chargebacks, and you are right, it is a bliss while you get scammed.<br />
But this is also a really curse to me, when guy wants to buy e.g. 10kk for paypal money, I am earning a lot for that amount of money but I can not even be sure that I will not loose the money in 10minutes after giving gold away.</div></div><hr />
