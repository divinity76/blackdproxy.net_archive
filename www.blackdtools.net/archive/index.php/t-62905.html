Story 
 
The last time we hosted the server, we had a few attacks. 
It was some tough DDoS attacks and we couldn't handle it unfortunately. 
One thing led to another, it became chaotic and long story short, we had to close the server. 
We've written a long paragraph about this when it happened, and refunded donations." />

Story<br />
<br />
The last time we hosted the server, we had a few attacks.<br />
It was some tough DDoS attacks and we couldn't handle it unfortunately.<br />
One thing led to another, it became chaotic and long story short, we had to close the server.<br />
We've written a long paragraph about this when it happened, and refunded donations.<br />
<br />
This time we have a better server with more security, and we are one more staff member that's working hard.<br />
So we hope to survive DDoS attacks now, and even if we won't, the server WILL NOT close.<br />
The start will just get delayed.<br />
However, we can almost guarantee you that the start will go smooth without any kicks, so don't worry.<br />

Our training room is unique since at the highest floor you can push afk players and take <br />
their spots. Lower floors do have fully afk friendly spots though.<br />
<br />
<br />
8106<br />
The second floor of temple includes a few teleports and a spot to exchange Zavar tokens<br />
for valuable items.<br />
<br />
<br />
8107<br />
Our instances offer you a very difficult task to slay the bosses, and the reward might <br />
be pieces of the best gear available.<br />
<br />
<br />
8108<br />
To access the Mysterious Island you need to participate in certain events. The island is <br />
just a part of a bigger endgame quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
8109<br />
If you're strong enough, you might have the chance to face one of our Raid bosses that drop <br />
unique items.<br />
<br />
<br />
8110<br />
The Enigma city is a very calm city, every part of it has been thought about carefully, and <br />
who knows perhaps you'll find a hidden NPC somewhere, or even addon statues.<br />
<br />
<br />

The God of Zavar can give you access to the GM Island.<br />
<br />
