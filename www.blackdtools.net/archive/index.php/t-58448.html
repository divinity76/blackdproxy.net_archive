Blackd Proxy 24.0<br />
----------------------------<br />
 - Fixed another detectable thing in the cavebot attack function. Cavebot should be very hard to detect now. However we won't guarantee anything yet.<br />
 - Fixed a rare problem in market<br />
 - Fixed a common problem with the trainer menu<br />
 - Activating a premium scroll should not crash Blackd Proxy now<br />
 - Now cavebot will not have a time limit to kill monsters, unless you include this to your script: SetBot EnableMaxAttackTime=1<br />
 - Now cavebot will resync with Tibia client memory to ensure that it is really attacking the correct creature<br />
 - Now cavebot will not trigger any pk alarm during the first 5 seconds, to avoid false alarms<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackd Proxy 24.1<br />
----------------------------<br />
 - Some additional improvements to avoid autodetection.<br />
 - Added a command for advanced users: exiva &gt;&gt; will allow you to send bytes without autoheader. Only for advanced users!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackd Proxy 24.2<br />
----------------------------<br />
 - Fixed a bug that was stopping the cavebot.</div></div><hr />
