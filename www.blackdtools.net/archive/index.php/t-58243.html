Achievements/Quests:<br />
<br />
  I will list achievements here.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are the few guidelines that I will follow during this project:<br />
<br />
  Hunt using BlackProxy's CaveBot<br />
  Never hunt completely AFK.<br />
I might be working, watching tv, playing xbox, but the computer is always close to react to anything and answer messages to avoid being reported by players.<br />
  Use only scripts that I make, avoiding complicated stuff.<br />
  No extra help from my main character except the initial help.<br />
  Some times looting special items is more important than exp.</div></div><hr />

Where do you guys think I should lvl him? He is level 62 with 75/72 and decent equipment (mystic blade, demon shield, golden arm)</div></div><hr />

Any more suggestions? I am sure you will be catching up to my lvl very soon.. I rather take it slow but safe ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have only tried the -1 level, do you think I should give -2 a try?<br />
<br />
For those wondering, I am not using depositor or refiler - I do that manually because of the door and other things that would require more complicated scripts that are most likely detectable.<br />
<br />
I get around 50k/h experience. Loot is still to be calculated.<br />

If you are in Svargrond, there is two really good areas to script for the Barbarians even has a ramps to get back to town so you can make refillers/depositers to your liking. I wanted to check out Ice Golems myself, I was thinking of taking the long route, making him exiva move(west) exani hur &quot;up ( still going to see if this is possible ) Grats on the 70 bud, I hope to see more in the future! :D<br />

<br />
I died twice in the mines due to fighting 3 ice golems so I went back to frosts just to get some more levels and skills, but the mines are great and quiet. Is -2 safe? I mean with no crazy monsters I can't fight?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the barbarians and ice witches are botted 24/7 in my server :( but I will keep trying to get that spawn.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas for places? If people suggest places I will release those scripts :D</div></div><hr />

You can goto the west side of town, take the ramp leading west, head south, up another ramp, continue west until you reach these camps. The camp without the Ice Witches(To the east of the BIG Camp of Barbs/Ice Witches) is perfect for Red Pieces of Cloth and you can start it in around level 40~ EKs with decent gear/skills. -2 in the mines could be a lot of waste due to the Cult members dealing straight magical damage and your skills wont matter to block most of it(seems wasteful to me, I like to see my knights racking in profit) I'm still thinking of a few places but I honestly don't bot my prems so I cant really say what is best other then what I have explored with on my mains. Maybe soon I will venture into taking over some spawns with my Prems but for now I can only suggest what will work,<br />

I love to see another person taking the time out of their day to show us their own progress! I will get back to you on that, I have a script and I will PM it to you that goes from Svar Depot &gt; Barbs &gt; Loops so If you WANT to edit it to your own likings you are free to do so. Im not short on Premium Time, I just do not like running any form of packets on my main Prems, so If I had a side premium to just test on that would be wicked. I did want to try that by saving up my FACC loots and then putting that towards a prem scroll but on my server Prem scrolls sell for 700-750K and I have been STACKING bank to just level my mains and create uber Alts/obtain good gear/toys. I'm sure If you have any other questions I can show you around / tell you where to go just shoot me a pm.<br />

Nicely done on the botting thread though it looks like you atleast had some fun :) Hoping ya had a good summer BldMx and sorry for the loss, I have re-started more then acouple months ago myself and have been going hard again yet this time I never made a progress screenshot thread which I'm quite sad about, but within 4 maybe 5 months I've already made far more then I ever had in the 1.5 years of using BlackD, if you ever restart and play Tibia again you should get in contact with me and leave me a pm, Hope you've had a good summer bud and take care :)</div></div><hr />
