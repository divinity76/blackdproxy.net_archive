Guess we have to wait and see, as they made new &quot;punishment grades&quot; you might no longer be automaticly deleted, who knows ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">09-29-2012, 21:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Players will continue to be automatically deleted. Thats why they are removing permanent final warnings, since if they are caught for botting again they will be instant deleted. I read the full comment news bit</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had a previous punishment and a &quot;Final&quot; Warning you were unable to Transfer servers, what Hells has explained is that after the autumn update you have 120 days and you can transfer your characters that you were unable to Transfer before.<br />
<br />
Correct me if Im wrong, but sounds pretty cool :P<br />
