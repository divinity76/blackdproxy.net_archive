I would like to know who reset the posts I had? I had like 600 posts now I have got like 100+ posts.  
Were everyone's posts reset or just mine? 
 
 I want to remind You that Ive been banned once without any reason and my thread with chars with 1000 views and many posts was deleted as well.

If what you said happened few days ago then I don't really know why that happened.</div></div><hr />
