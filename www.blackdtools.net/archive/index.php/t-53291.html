	<meta name="description" content="Hello, I'm a very old member of this forum, I was very active here like 2 years ago but I had to stop playing tibia for personal reasons and now I'm back. I've seen there are a lot of new people and many of my old tibia friends are retired as well, but I hope someone remembers me :) 
 
I'm right now buying BlackD again and I'm gonna start playing at Morgana I think, with a friend. If someone wants to talk to me I would apreciate that, thank you!" />
