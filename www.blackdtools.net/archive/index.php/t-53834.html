Just wondering if anyone has worked out how to Setfollow in cavebot now? 
 
It is common knowledge that &quot;Set follow&quot; doesn't work. 
 
People used to click the &quot;green man&quot; ingame and it would make sure you follow. But with the new attack method it seems my green man will never stay clicked." />

Options-General-AutoChase Off  and unselect it. If it still does not work, then you shall message BlackD about this matter for a quick fix.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I did this shortly after posting. It helps... abit... But still isn't perfect.<br />
<br />
Daniel has said he won't be updating BlackD Proxy so I don't see a point in Emailing him about the matter :/</div></div><hr />
