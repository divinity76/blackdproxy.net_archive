<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-13-2012, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">try the newest version (27.3) I think it should fix the remaining bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-13-2012, 22:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing is if your in the habit of always just opening BlackD and starting, maybe you need to run your original Tibia and patch first, then re-download the newest 27.3 version of BlackD Proxy. That is the only thing that comes to mind, hope it helps.<br />

<br />
whats actually happening is tibia is opening and blackd is opening but blackd isnt connecting to actual tibia, <br />
<br />
like when you click &quot;look&quot; on a tile it doesnt tell you the code and stuff just says &quot;you see a tile&quot;,<br />
<br />
so for some reason the bot isnt injecting into the game, very frustrating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-15-2012, 09:40</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, seems very weird. The only other thing I can possibly think of is maybe your anti-virus is blocking something? What kind of anti-virus do you run and try allowing it via some settings in your anti-virus Ill think some more on it, maybe you also loaded the wrong config? Just some suggestions,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-15-2012, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Your antivirus or firewall might be blocking the functions that blackd proxy needs to handle tibia connection.<br />
You can try uninstalling your antiviruses and install Microsoft Security Essentials instead. It is good, free and compatible with Blackd Proxy.</div></div><hr />

My cavebot seems to work just fine. Please use Google Translator with proper grammar and spelling and maybe we will understand what you mean?<br />

I mean that Cavebot after a while, does not collect</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't even your thread, and you have to let Cavebot know what you want to loot by finding the item IDs for that item/npc loot<br />
if you want more help you should probably make your own thread and specify your problems.<br />
