<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">11-15-2010, 09:52</div></div><div class="posttext">if it's like a real credit card just enter it in the ADD Credit Card or just transfer money from it using same feature with paypal.. or just simply go on google type in &quot;Visa Gift Card Paypal&quot; and done you got ur answer:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the long answer: Yes, it is possible to link a prepaid gift card like the Visa or American Express gift card to a PayPal account but for this to happen, you need to pray and hope that PayPal does not require you to go through their Expanded Use verification process. To better understand why, you first need to be familiar with the process for linking a credit card to a PayPal account. When you link your credit card to a PayPal account, PayPal will attempt to confirm your address with your credit card company. If the credit card company is not able to confirm your address, then you may be asked by PayPal to complete their Expanded Use enrollment process in order to activate your credit card.</div></div><hr />
