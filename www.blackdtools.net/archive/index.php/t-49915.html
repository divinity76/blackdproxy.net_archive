 <br />
People trust in me (I have very high reputation) so I can sell the accounts for a good price, so I can also pay you a good price. Both of us can get a very profitable business here.<br />
 <br />
Please contact me by email with subject &quot;Partner for leveling chars&quot; Please remember to include prices and times.<br />

 <br />
well, I dont care, but to ensure they are clean I must see that they must survive a ban wave after the leveling is completed, so if you use cheats for leveling them please ensure that they are safe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'd think the means of achieving the levels are irrelevant, so long as the account doesn't get banned or really bad reputation. sounds like a profitable idea indeed, but why settle for level 50? if i had more spare time on my hands, i'd be interested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-20-2010, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a safe account level 50 can already be sold for a lot of money and still affordable for most people. Higher level would cost a lot of time more and we would have to sell it a lot more expensive so probably nobody would buy it. But of course we can also try other levels if business goes good and we get requests of people wanting chars of different levels (and willing to pay the high cost of that)</div></div><hr />

of course, paying in Tibia gold is no problem for me.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Depends. Tell me the price to level up the char with premium and tell me the price to level up the char without premium. If the difference is more than 20 euros then of course I will pay the pacc :)</div></div><hr />
