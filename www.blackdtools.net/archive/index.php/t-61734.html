Many players like blackd bot cuz it works in any Tibia version, speacialy old versions (7.x)<br />
<br />
Most ot servers 7.x has anti bot protection or custom client to avoid botters. Custom client is an edited client that &quot;class name&quot; is changed, so many bots will not inject on it. Fortunately blackd bot is open source, so you can change the conf.txt inside blackd folder to custom client class (tibiaclassname=tibiaclient). (you can have custom client class name with a program like &quot;WinId&quot;).<br />
<br />
I already did it on original tibia ot and worked (it was necessary to set ot ip and correct port at proxy). Now im having trouble to inject it on another otservers old versions like &quot;classicus&quot; or &quot;oldwar.hopto.org/oldwar&quot;.<br />
<br />
I cant figure out how to inject. it should be helpful for a lot of blackd bot users</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oclipper</div><div class="date">06-21-2014, 20:27</div></div><div class="posttext">I discovered how to inject blackd bot on edited clients, follow the tutorial:<br />
<br />
Originaltibia.com<br />
<br />
Tutorial - how to inject on original tibia server 2<br />
<br />
Inside your instalation folder &quot;conf772&quot;, open the .txt and edit the client &quot;class&quot;  (default is TibiaClient);<br />
<br />
ctrl+f and insert the new class (u can also find it with program like WinID for another custom clients):<br />
tibiaclassname=Tmmm¬mmm&#338;mmm<br />
<br />
Go to &quot;Proxy&quot; option and set &quot;forward to bouncer&quot;<br />
proxy ip: originaltibia.com (ur otserver IP)<br />
login port: 7172 (default is 7171)<br />
gameport: 7072 (default is 7172)<br />
<br />
unmark<br />
[ ] Change all tibia clients memory<br />
[ ] Change character list packets<br />
<br />
Open Tibia custom client, back to &quot;Proxy&quot; and mark:<br />
<br />
[x] Change all tibia clients memory<br />
[x] Change character list packets<br />
<br />
It will work in any tibia custom client, you need to know &quot;class&quot;, &quot;ip&quot;, &quot;login port&quot; and &quot;game port&quot;. If the server has anti bot protection many functions may ban ur account</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm trying to get this thing to work on a custom ot, but the bot can't find the client. When I try &quot;tibia mc&quot; it opens one, but it doesn't connect with the client. I used cmd to find out the ip and the game port like explained but I get stuck. <br />
Anyone able to help? I'm willing to pay for it to work.<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

probably custom ot has different classname also anti bot protection then most of functions lead you to instant account delet. If you want just a simple tool such as light and healer:<br />

<br />
So... I have change the classname in config.txt in the 772 folder. I have found the IP and the game port using command netstat -n. What I don't know is the login port, which from what I can read is found by simple brute force. I've tried a few combos, but im not really sure &quot;How many&quot; it could be. like ive tried 7171, 7172, 7272, 7070.</div></div><hr />

the problem in such servers they have bot protection (NOT in client). and this instantly delet your character, just before you try any function.</div></div><hr />
