If it does, whatever he added gets dished out and then he tries another thing :o<br />
<br />
Btw, Im also curious, who will be the first to fall on the bans? xD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zKad</div><div class="date">03-18-2010, 05:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Instant ban system? I didn't see that, the only thing they said that is a character that gotta bannished is gonna be kicked of the game, what wasn't happen before, you gotta banished by mass ban and if you're online at this time you stay untill you logout of the game or the server save... <br />
<br />
But if what you said is true, damn boy I think it's a good thing for the bot developers test their tools...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dach</div><div class="date">03-18-2010, 05:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not instant ban... its when they scan and get the 5k players they will get kicked after a while. So they aren't able to keep them online til server save and send all money to main chars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Characters that receive a banishment will get automatically kicked out of the game within a narrow time frame. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be to easy to find what is catching botters if they change the system to yours...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zell</div><div class="date">03-18-2010, 08:22</div></div><div class="posttext">As dach said it doesnt kick you when you are detected, only when they ban the 5k accounts etc. It would be funny if they kicked you as soon as they detected you..you could be hunting with a friend and they get kicked because they are banned lol</div></div><hr />

Because I use bots to make money and train my knight and I think that if you now get banned for botting 20 minutes or somthing its much easyer for the bot creators to see what packages is being sent and then prevent the bot from sending it or something hehe I'm not so into this but someone said it on the 1st page in this thread :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">03-19-2010, 01:23</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish they change it to real instant ban soon. That way it would be very easy to see what is being detected and how to avoid detection :)<br />
 <br />
For now I could test in last ban wave that using Blackd Proxy itself doesnt ban you. It seems to be only a problem of cavebot. In fact I got chars banned only for using cavebot for 2 minutes. Well, you can be sure I am reworking the whole cavebot system to get an undetectable cavebot. Until that... dont use cavebots!</div></div><hr />
