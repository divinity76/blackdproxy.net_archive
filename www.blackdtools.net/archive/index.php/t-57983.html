I used exiva addmove from my starting point (the depot), and went all the way to the place where I want to bot. When I go down ledges do I exiva addmove at the square on the ledge, and then another exiva addmove when I'm up on the 2nd level?<br />
<br />
Also, lets say that I am at my hunting spot, but since I have waypoints starting all the way from the depot, when I hit gotoScriptLine 0 on my script, and I'm already at the hunting spot, will it auto move me back to the waypoints of the depot? or would it continue along points through my script at the hunting area?<br />
<br />
Lastly, for the depositer, I know I use the ifTrue function, then add way points to backtrack all the way back to my town depot. Lets say after my script gets me back to my depot and deposits everything, if I add a gotoScriptLine 0, will it start back all the way from the beginning of my script, from where I first started to move from the depot to my hunting place and continue hunting there?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the noob questions, but if I can figure this out I might be making a few scripts and posting them later as well, just difficult to try to start :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
im just a noobie to, just using the probgram for like 24hours now...<br />
<br />
but in my opinion it will start all the way over....<br />
but u can choose to hit at the end of ur script ''gotoscriptline 30'' for exemple.. (or any other line where u are in the hunting place)<br />
also u can use labels...<br />
i dont know how it works exactly but its something like this:<br />
<br />
:depot (ur script to from hunting place to depot and back)<br />
:hunting (ur script at the hunting place)<br />
:safe (ur script about what to do mhen in danger)<br />
and so on.... so u can tell ur script something like when cap is under 10 go to :depot<br />
when cap is above 10 go to :hunting<br />
when health is below 25% go to :safe<br />
<br />
<br />
hope it helps... im trying it myself a lot a.t.m :)<br />
<br />
plz correct me if i am wrong!! :cool:</div></div><hr />
