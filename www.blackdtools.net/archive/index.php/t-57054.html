exura ico<br />
<br />
When my mana gets above 300 on my knight, he casts exura ico. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
Now, you can change amount of mana and spell of course. For an example, if you're botting a mage, let's say you have 2500 mana when fully regained and you want to cast spell so it isn't full and it keeps regaining, you just simply set a number lower than 2500, let's say 2450.<br />
<br />
You can easily change amounts according to what vocation/level you're playing. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It goes under 'Conditional events' ... save it as .txt document and throw it in 'conds' folder inside BlackD Proxy folder, then reload files in 'Conditional events' section of the bot, search for saved file and load it.</div></div><hr />
