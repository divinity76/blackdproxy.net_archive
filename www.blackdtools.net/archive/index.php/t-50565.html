<br />
<br />
Good things about the restaurant<br />
Its very good for my CV later.<br />
<br />
bad things about the restaurant.<br />
I dont like the people.<br />
i have to do all the dirty jobs<br />
i need to ride atleast 2 houres every day on my bike . and 2 times in the week even 3,5 houres when i got a break at the midday.<br />
they think iv got an IQ of a dog or even lower<br />
they think im on drugs. <br />
when i ask when I can go home they say HERMAN STOP ASKING IT IF YOU ASK IT ONE MORE TIME YOU CAN LEAVE HERE FOREVER<br />

<br />
<br />
Let me explain it <br />

<br />
I told it to my teachers but my teachers are pussys they are &quot;scared&quot; of such a high class chef cook<br />
<br />
they only told me let it go just stay there<br />
<br />
<br />
If it was on another company they already called the boss of that firm and gave me another firm -.-<br />
<br />
a school mate of my had the same problem and he had another firm in like 2 days :s</div></div><hr />

<br />
Work harder. (Atleast sometimes.)<br />
<br />
Show them your work is easy.<br />
<br />
And anyway, keep working there.<br />
<br />
It's indeed very good for ur CV, even if they use you as 'loopjongen'.(Boy they abuse to do the boring stuff.)<br />
I work at the Vegetable&amp;fruits department at Jumbo and I had to do shitty works for a year too, but now my job is alot better than that and my payment too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaling</div><div class="date">05-23-2010, 20:52</div></div><div class="posttext">You cant work hard if you dont know shit about food.. It's his first job so it's hard to show some1 ells he's the best, you guys have to understand that.<br />
<br />
Lexxis if I where you I would ask for explanation of the food you are working with. If they dont give you that, fuck them and write bad things on the internet about them:p I expect you make cold food in the beginning? Just keep your voice low and do what they say, but if you need to do something new, ask/demand for explanation, if they turn mad on you and do it themselves, contact ur teacher. <br />
<br />
P.S. can you pm me the restaurant ur working? I'm making a restaurant guide for all the horeca (dont know how to spell it in english) in the Netherlands. <br />
<br />
Goodluck,<br />

They let you do the dirty jobs or atleast let you work really hard but if you get throught with it good they will respect that and write in ur cv that your a good worker. And &quot;When can i go home&quot; is a pretty stupid question to ask your boss. You quit when they tell you that you can go home not earlyer so you should'nt ask that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlzNoKil</div><div class="date">05-24-2010, 00:53</div></div><div class="posttext">i would not agree with you razoor at that going home part.<br />
or, asking that &quot;can i go home?&quot; question, thats stupied, yes, BUT you should not work until your boss says &quot;thats it for today, you can go home&quot;.<br />
<br />
you should agree on a fixed working hours with your supervisor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
u should stop complaining, bow down, work hard and once they see u are good at what u do and able to learn, they give u other things to do. that is what has top priority, also in many other jobs (there are top-politicans who studied biology, i beg u): BEING ABLE TO LEARN FURTHER. as long as u cant show them that u are, u wont get anywhere.</div></div><hr />
