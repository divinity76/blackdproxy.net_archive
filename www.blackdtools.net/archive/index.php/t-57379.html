Does not attack monsters on the way to town and back, so add Centipede, Snake and Bat to safelist or attacklist.

Edit : And the same for looting maces and what not. Gold is more efficient to cap. :3<br />
<br />
Kind regards, ~~Reki</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to buy any pots, put &quot;fastExiva _pots = 0&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So sorry, you need to put &quot;_leavepots = 0&quot; too. Didn't think of that. :p</div></div><hr />

@edit: it's working now.<br />
Can this bot open another backpacks when space in main bp ends?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munn</div><div class="date">04-05-2012, 12:38</div></div><div class="posttext">This bot didn't work very well for me. Started it in outskirts of venore, it ran to the cave and started botting, but in few places, the bot stuck with message &quot;There is no way.&quot; And I had to manually help him out. Probably because waypoints were too far apart? Would love to use this script otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Excellent scripts...Thanks so much for what you do!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">handtrall</div><div class="date">06-30-2012, 04:27</div></div><div class="posttext">For me it does one lap in the cave then returns to buy pots, even tho I have the exact amount of pots in my BP as in the script line.<br />
<br />
Otherwise the script works like a charm, too bad it goes back to deposit so often.<br />
I'm really new to these scripts too, but I've tried to change some lines but it hasn't fixed my problem yet.<br />
<br />
Still, thanks for your awesome scripts.</div></div><hr />
