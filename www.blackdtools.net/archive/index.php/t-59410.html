This page is going to be under construction for awhile, I need time to take some screens of Gear, Skills, Exp of about five seperate characters I will be using for this small botting project.<br />
<br />
Hope to see some friendly faces around the community and maybe even throw in some tips along the way, I will never say no to advice and knowledge of Blackd.<br />

These will be the five knights I will be using for this project, It will not be a full-time project as I still want a life, but It is to keep track of progress and income over-time. <br />
<br />
All of these Knights have been started from level one with BlackD, After I am finished fully I may release scripts, and tips and tricks on the thoughts/ideas I've had with money making.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a side note, Knight E's income will not be recorded until it is semi-profittable. He is botting with Softs and little to no waste, but no major income to be recorded yet.<br />

<br />
Oct 17 2012  - <br />
7376 Tibia accounts have been detected using unofficial software to play during the last couple of weeks. These accounts have been deleted today.<br />
<br />
Would like everyone to know, again not a single ban in over a year no matter botting 24/7 or botting for a few hours on my premiums. Seems as if you write your own scripts you seem to be safe and under the radar.<br />
<br />
Another thing, Id like some opinions on the Layout of the project, If anyone would like to see any changes/additions screenshots of the actual characters doing their job let me know what you folks want to see!<br />

Only joking, right now I am running an undead script for Gold/Life Rings/Brown/Yellow/White Cloth/Bonelord Eyes, I will release the script or the location when I am done with it as of right now It is the best money maker with little to no waste I can find on the FACC Side, less experience but more money.<br />
<br />
On a further note I will be updating A &amp; B into a new script once they reach roughly 85-90 thinking either POH/Orc Fortress to make some good profit.<br />
<br />
C &amp; D Will stay to farm their current script for money and Knight E will be moved into a premium Undead location, Any suggestions as to where move a Premium knight for farming, looking into Tombs right now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for following Hells~ If your still really interested PM me, Im sure we can work somethin out!<br />
<br />
Also a little teaser after the ban wave so everyone can say Hi to the farmers!<br />

<br />
Also. For undeads in Prem area, you need to check out treasure island! There are non reset places where you can store loot. On my server some kid has been stacking loot there for months. I have stolen like 800k~ in just GP/CREAUTE PRODUCE. If I attempted to steal the items too I'd be even more rich! But fuck that haha.<br />
<br />
I guess your faac undeads in Mt sternum as everyone else is (at least 10+ level 50-90s) on my server botting there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">10-19-2012, 10:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Colours! A fellow canadian as well or you just know how to spell :D Wow! I will definitely look into that and rofled at 800k~ in creature loot.<br />
<br />
Yes, underneath Mt.Sternum a lot of addon items to be made, and unfortunately I've been having problems with PKs, good thing I have several PK mages and two Premiums.<br />
<br />
Curious if your interested in starting another server? I could float you some money to begin and I have atleast 30+ Blessed Free accounts with Knights within 30-50 you could use fully blessed to never lose gear, could use a teammate to pk with shoot me a msg if your interested!<br />
<br />
As in serveral pk mages I so far have;<br />
75 Master<br />
45 Sorc<br />
44 Druid<br />
37 Sorc<br />
36 Elder<br />
31 Master<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">10-19-2012, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, Just a quick update over the week dont really like botting on the weekends will give the boys a break an let their feet rest for a day or two.<br />
<br />
Heres the over all Total's for week one! ( Remember most days were half days and probably still will be half! )<br />
<br />
Cash ; 290K / 5 Days time<br />
<br />
Loot ; 206k / 5 Days time<br />
<br />
Waste ; 33k / 5 Days time<br />
<br />
Grand Total ; 290K Cash + 206K Loot - 33K Waste = 463K in 5 Days time running two scripts/two knights none of E's money has been included in any of these totals so far.<br />
<br />
I really don't like to include Loot towards my bank balance, as I will use most of the life rings, and slowly stockpile the monster loot until its overflowing from my bags. So I'll consider this week as 300K made towards my bank balance.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for following so far or even just taking a peek, I hope this sparks some interest and makes the Blackd community a little more active! Taking a break for the weekend I hope you all enjoyed and leave some feedback!<br />

<br />
Alright, boys feet had a little rest and I got some extra sleep it appears! Bots shut off and I had gone for a power nap that turned into a 14+ Hour snooze (/.-  (smack self in face) restarting Day 6 today and back to work on E's new script. Hope everyone had a good weekend!<br />
<br />
Alright, not too much progress on E today, I got the script written and after about an hour and a bit I got sick of all the foot traffic coming in and out &amp; or checking on me. Rewrote a new script and testing at the moment, hopefully It goes all night!<br />
<br />
Scripts workin' alright but its wasting a few pots and not something I trust over night without my eyes on it, maybe might set him back up @ 20k/hr overnight just to hit 50 and get his new sword. New script hits 28k/hr Avg and wicked loot, 36k/hr w/ bonus.<br />

Today is going to be tricky, I am being camped inside PZ with one of the boys, but they are almost out of stamina as well, so I will try and do a half day with B &amp; D then shut it down around the half day mark when the girl is off work.<br />

Today was a total bust, was camped by guild who &quot;controls&quot; the server, anyways I'm surprised they killed my 70 knight, I usually only die if I'm AFK but I was impressed by the pvp skills of these two. I guess Ill just call Day 8 a bust and turn off the boys for the rest of the day!</div></div><hr />

Alright, I'm going to give the boys who were being camped a little bit of a break for few days so that means ill throw A &amp; C into the mix after my physiotherapy today instead of letting the boys be AFK all day long, Ill keep a keen eye and make sure they are doing their jobs.<br />
<br />
A - 80&gt;81<br />
<br />

Yesterday was quite tricky, Seems I may be stepping on some toes with this project, a psycho 190~ EK would not stop trying to kill me on several characters chasing me all the way to the depot. ( Knight shooting MWalls in full Crystal Warlord outfit ) was slightly scary. Hopefully with a little rest these boys will get back to work near to full time!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">10-26-2012, 19:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Hells~ I love the outfit myself as well, I would like to get full assassin for my master sometime in the near future! More screenshots of my Alts and Prem/Free PKs next week! Anyways folks, I hope everyone enjoyed the short week, but as it is Friday I don't like to bot during the weekends so here is a short summary for our short week! <br />
<br />
Week 2 ;<br />
<br />
Cash ; 223K / 4 Days Time<br />
<br />
Loot ; 175K / 4 Days Time<br />
<br />
Waste ; 20K / 4 Days Time<br />
<br />
Grand Total ; 223K Cash + 175K Loot - 20K Waste = 378K / 4 Days Time <br />
<br />
As always I take some of the loots for myself such as Life Rings, sometimes even the Eyes/Paws/Iron Ore for outfits ;D so I'll total this at 300K~ Cash towards my total bank balance for Week 2.<br />
<br />
Alright so as far as a short week it was still a decent haul, I'm not greedy and I can share, these folks on my server on the other hand are really starting to agitate me. I will win, but I may have to start putting some of this total away for extra PK Supplies, Time Rings, more Manas/Healths, Backup Blessing costs etc. <br />
<br />
As a side note I also wanted to say I've written some pretty good scripts to keep Knight E busy hopefully in a week/two weeks I will start adding his loot list into the mix!<br />
<br />
I hope everyone enjoyed Week 2! Hope to see/hear from you guys next week and have a great weekend!<br />

<br />
Welcome to the beginning of Week 3!<br />
<br />
Alright, well I hope everyone had a good weekend, I'm going to put the boys to work a half day early and see how it goes today, on a side note, gonna keep letting B &amp; D rest for another day or so to let the heat die down before they get back to work!<br />
<br />
Going to try and work on Knight E, but his stamina is always so low I'm contemplating adding a Knight F into the project, let me know if you guys want me to keep it short and sweet, but I started last night and got a knight up to Lvl 14 with 89/81 skills hopefully to catch up with Knight E to take over half the grind.<br />
<br />
A - 81&gt;82<br />
<br />
C - 71&gt;73<br />
<br />
E - 52&gt;56<br />
<br />
Serious amount of PK attempts yesterday! That psycho 190 EK has a serious grudge, he even brought a 115 RP today and still failed ;D<br />

<br />
Wasn't a bad day for the boys, not a full one but they still pulled their weight, and it seems that this project is stepping into someone elses income because I am now being attacked on a daily basis if not multiple times per day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also a teaser for Week 3 here are the boys protectors! Coming tomorrow, the Premium PKs &gt;;D<br />

<br />
They are dressed alike, name is close in characters so very hard to target, need to work on the 31~ Master when I get some free time but this will be a deadly combo when completed.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I want to power the 31 up to 55-60~ for a double UE combo and these characters are on my mains~ so leveled completely by hand.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for upcoming photos &quot;Prem PKs&quot; 2 and the PK Radio.<br />

<br />
Alright! Getting back into the groove of week three, I have all day to myself so I plan on botting strong and playing the main most of the day maybe catch a few levels on my lower level MS after I run out of stamina.<br />
<br />
Had the woman sleep over last night and physio first thing in the morning so bots were started a little late but any money made is a bonus to me. I have scripted out quite a good loop over night for Knight E so I keep thinking this needs to be used more I am definitely going to be adding in a Knight F when I get some time. Another update, Knight A &amp; B are getting very close to my goal so I need to start thinking about scripting some more difficult free areas for the future, stay tuned folks.<br />

<br />
Total Profit ; 95K Cash + 85K Loot - 12K Waste = 168K Total Profit @ 24-28~ H<br />

Sorry for the late update guys, the boys were rotated roughly halfway through the day and A &amp; C are back dusting up their boots. Yesterday was definitely a good haul and hopefully this carries on for the rest of the week!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright! A &amp; C are grinding away while I am going to put on some work onto Knight F and catch it up a bit by hand so it can safely bot without me having to watch possibly bless it up and deck it out around level 25~ then set him farming nightly as well! On a side note, yesterday I also put a little bit of work into my Low Lvl MS and went from 31&gt;35 nearly 36 so hopefully soon I will post some good PK screens &gt;;D Happy Halloween everyone, be safe and hope your enjoying my thread!<br />

Starting to get the hang of these pk attacks, they happen at certain times when they can band together and come close to killing me but its never enough &gt;;D Good haul last night, passed out early unfortunately so didnt get much work into Knight F :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright, made plans with the girl later tonight and the boys are quite low on stamina as I am not using a 3 man rotation. So going to dust up their boots for 8-9 Hours, let them rest and hopefully pull off another half day tomorrow!<br />
<br />
Alright! Well everything didn't go as according to plan yesterday and the boys were out of stamina sooner than I had thought, It seems with only running 2 out of the 3 knights I can farm 4/5 Days~ out of a 7 Day week. I will re start the boys today and combine there minimal loot with yesterdays and call this a real &quot;half-day&quot; after they grind off their last 8 Hours. Hope everyone has been enjoying so far and a little teaser for next week will be the &quot;Alternate Mains&quot; &amp; &quot;Alternate Prem PKs&quot; stay tuned!<br />

<br />
Total Profit ; 45K Cash + 35K Loot - 4K Waste = 76K Total Profit @ 10 Hours~<br />

Alright, well Thursday/Friday turned into a slight bust, the boys were generally just out of stamina and I was busy with the woman, but I will not say no to 75K~ towards my bank balance for doing next to no work, this is the end of Week 3! Hope everyone enjoyed and the grand totals for the entire week should be posted as soon as possible!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very impressed, do your scripts have depositers? Or do you just run them to depot on no cap?<br />
<br />
PM me your server I am very interested :p <br />
<br />
You are making sick amounts of Bholder eyes, I bet they boosting up your profits!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately the amount of Beholder Eyes I have started to accumulate has driven the price down nearly 1K Each, so now it is down to 2K each eye.<br />
<br />
Hah, I will have to PM you, maybe if your interested I got a free account you could take over and call yours, should be full blessed and the works :) <br />

Alright, Holy smokes I even had to re-double check the numbers, that was a pretty fat haul for four days, it was actually 5 days but the last two days there were very short due to the boys being out of stamina so I combined the totals and made it look like atleast one half day for Day 14. Stay tuned folks, coming next week are the good pics &gt;;D Have a great weekend guys.<br />
<br />
As a side note I will be calling this a rough 400K~ towards my bank balance for week 3.<br />

Stay the eff out of my cave! He ended up coming back, so while chasing him out we ran dead on into a red skull and this kind red skull decided to take my side and finish off this poor soul for a second time. STAY OUT!<br />

<br />
After we became pretty good friends, He didn't speak english but we could understand eachother well enough, we decided to wander up towards Kaz due to all the PK trapping that has been happening there as of late and ran straight into two friends in which I finished up quite quickly, I locked us away where we would be safe and wait off our skulls, he says &quot;No more!&quot; &quot;+1 an im BLACK!&quot; I safely escorted him to where he could log and we parted our ways!<br />
<br />
And this is the end of the teaser for week 3, stay tuned folks I hope you are enjoying the PK Radio!<br />

Alright, gettin an early start on Monday! Lets fire these boys up and make some money while I sleep &amp; welcome to week 4 &gt;;D<br />
<br />
Well woke up with a slight start all the boys were offline, so it seems my net crashed middle of the night, there packs look full so Id say a rough 3-4~ Hours before they were kicked off, no deaths on the bright side and put right back to work =)<br />

<br />
Very bad day with all the internet kicks ( Thank god no one died to mobs ) PK Attempts, PK Fails ( Due to being hunted two lvl 120~ RPs with a grudge against my FACC Killas ) This was a shitty day, thank god their was some profit, I put it directly toward my hunteds and will continue to do so, my main bank is steady for a while, I think a month of piling bank into some pks is what is needed and with my RL coming back full time I will have a partner-in-crime so stay tuned for some epic PKs.<br />
<br />
Sneak Peak for Day 15! <br />
http://i1297.photobucket.com/albums/ag21/Lithium149/Chars/PKing/PKWIN3.png<br />
<br />
A group that has been harassing me for some time, the 6th man is in the top right corner near my equipment paper doll, it seems he was lagging behind and I didnt stop to click &amp; see his level. On my way out of the cave running like hell I encountered a 7th trying to Mwall me off as the 117~ RP decided to tear me a new one. Escaped without a death on either front and wasted roughly 40 potions during the attempt. And a slight tip! A 117 RP Should not be casting utani gran hur -.- Better luck next time.<br />
<br />
Some very upsetting news for Day 15, Death on all FACC Protectors, and one even lost all his blessings due to forgetting to re-bless(stupidity) so he is now turned into a wastable lvl 40~ Sorc..Tear ;.(</div></div><hr />

And stay tuned folks, coming up this week is the Alternate Prem PKs and my Alternate Mains that I play on my downtime by hand! :D<br />

Also, as a side note, most of the income goes back towards my many of characters that I enjoy playing by hand on my two main Prems.<br />

Alright, hella slept in with the girl so the boys got a very late start, about afternoon, so Id say probably a 12 hour haul If there is smooth sailing! Hope everyone is enjoyin the pics and the rewards as much as I am ;p Stay tuned, up coming Alt Prem PK# 2!<br />
<br />
Well due to the update the boys were off all night/morning. So its going to be another late afternoon start! Ill tally the numbers shortly folks!<br />
<br />
Alright, well slightly sad BlackD is going through a few updates but thats not the sad part.. While BlackD was being updated I was bringing home the boys one by one due to no MC and zoned out txting, died infront of depot to a mid-lvl mage and lost an entire level on Knight D due to the big level difference. After I smacked my self in the face and raged a little IRL I hopped on my 75 Master and went and crushed him silly, he had turned red skull and he popped a few pieces of gear which made up for my rage and knowing he got nothing due to my blessings on Knight D. Take that you POS, never taking eyes off screen again w/ no conditionals running. Giving Daniel a break and also the boys, will resume when BlackD is fully updated.<br />

Alright! Sorry for the late update folks, took the boys off a little early yesterday, went and had to do some RL things and leaving the boys AFK on a Friday is not such a good idea. Also this weeks numbers are going to be quite low due to all the PK-attempts and losses I've taken with Twist of Fates but, better then losing gear and every penny adds towards my grand total.<br />
<br />
Up coming are this weeks totals, and like I promised, the next Prem PK :D <br />

<br />
Hope everyone has a good weekend, and I shall see everyone come Monday &amp; Stay tuned for more pictures of the boys and upcoming next week, my Alternate Mains that I enjoy playing by hand when the boys are busy farming!</div></div><hr />

Also, the trick with this druid, is draining the opponent, I heal all monsters with exura mas sio until he gets overwhelmed, then heal the mob he hits singlely with IHs or UHs and eventually he will get overwhelmed and die.

<br />
So far not so good boys, aside from the internet drop first thing this morning, the getting pked while picking up weed, atleast after dinner I was able to witness the PK going down, after raging for two minutes and chasing them with an avenger up their ass I rushed there on the 75 Master Sorcerer you have previously seen, One shot the red skull lower level with and SD, UE'd and killed both 46 and 51 Master's that were about to lock on with SDs and Summons, Problem dealt with, back to work you lazy buggers!<br />

Well unfortunately didn't get too much of a haul for the first day of week 5! But it seems that I have been getting harrassed by multiple teams for botting their location, many of new people sharing my cave, internet drops and gank upon gank on a daily basis. But with all of the action &amp; excitement it is completely worth it, nothing felt better then slaying noobs 3 v 1 for harrassing my boys! Welcome to week 5 my friends, I hope everyone is enjoying my PK Radio.<br />

Well yesterday was alright, unfortunately it seems I am having the week of as soon as I leave the house for 10 minutes I am under attack, went to pickup my RL to blaze and Knight C took another beating and a 11K Twist of Fate hit, although he made more then he spent I am still upset with him, Knight A is cruising along, while sleeping the other night my alarms went off, to lazy to get out of bed Knight A was able to keep ahead of them, kill &amp; loot and keep walking without interruption, back to sleep after muting my headphones, gg. Alright without further adieu on to Day 21 ! Stay tuned and hope I'm sparking a little interest within the BlackD Community!</div></div><hr />

Dang, already middle of the week were just flying along here, seems the bots are getting half days and if that if I seem to be lucky.. But who can complain about free money? Didn't get to rotating the boys yesterday so I decided this morning I am going to start B &amp; D off fresh with full stamina! Sometime this week I will be taking a teaser shot of my Alternate Druid I like to play by hand when I get the free time.<br />
<br />
Side note ; Knight B is so very close to my goal, Im hoping within the next few weeks here I will be running some new scripts and some new loot for everybody to take a look at daily ;)<br />

What a horrible ending to the week, I figured I could get one last deposit out of the boys, leave the room for a minute and come back to a lvl 260 RP and 220~ MS absolutely crushing me. I was getting low and tired of running so I turned off my heals and said finish the job, they were leaving me in low hp and I couldn't figure out why, I decided to force log and have my character poof before their eyes! I check Tibia.com continuously until I figure out they must be keeping him online somehow, I log back and at 50~ HP dying to fire, I quickly heal up and look at the situation, im trapped and have now 3 high levels trapping me with empty bottles and gp and killing me by fire. I make a quick decision of showing up on a lower char to finish the job. Getting there with my 45~ MS I am unable to kill Knight A due to them now sioing him. After killing my 45~ Mage I finally raged, brought the 75 MS and ran their with utani gran hur at breakneck speed. Upon rolling up like a fucking ferrari I e-wave the trap holding in Knight A and kill him one hit and piss off the lvl 200s like swatting a bee hive with a Thunder Hammer after getting Crushed again by these level 200s I claim my victory in that I never lost my Free Account blessing. Back to work come Monday you fucking slackers.<br />
<br />
Edit; Knight A is also now 100% hunted by the top dog on this server. He will no longer be able to farm without a watcher and will be attacked every hour on the hour if not more. Things are about to get interesting within the next few weeks here guys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">11-17-2012, 00:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch, Im sorry to hear Wordies~ have to be careful in Tibia and trusting certain people and the sites you visit! Here is a pro-tip my RL cousin taught me, if you are every worried about visiting a site open it with &quot;Sandboxie&quot; And if it seems harmful you can Terminate and clean all programs within the sandbox. Anyways tips on getting started, use three knights if you want a 24 hour rotation, get a rook set and start from scratch. Rook&gt;Trolls or Swamp Trolls&gt;Amazons &amp; Valkyries&gt; Carry on from there? Start free accounts in case the ban wave hits you just forward all your money to your main account. Second of all, because your characters are going to be unblessed you will be using poor gear like p-sets so incase you die you aren't losing a fortune. Any money made helps and goes towards the main premium that you can use for new gear or to power game your main up hard. Anyways these are just a few tips the biggest one of all is learn how to write these scripts by hand, mostly just walking around and typing &quot;exiva pos&quot; and copy &amp; pasting co-ordinates into a notepad, once done all the co-ords you need to add your setMeleekill lists, your SetLoot lists, your depositer and a many things you can read about all within these BlackD forums. All it takes is a good few days of trial &amp; error and a ton of reading! Even comparing your scripts to others is a very good way to learn, note I dont like to use peoples &quot;fastExiva&quot; commands because I consider these to send packets and when Tibias are updated and scripts are not these may send bad packets leading to &quot;automatic detection&quot; hope this helped at all Wordies, sorry again to hear about the Hack my friend.<br />

@Wordies, A bunch of reading! And trial and error, like I said boot up a fresh notepad and go at it! Take a peek at others work just to get the jist of it! dont need to make anything fancy but start something that just loops and collects. Don't release your scripts for use to public until you are completely done with them, that is my recommendations. Good luck with everything Wordies and leave a message, Ill keep this project going for awhile, already have figured out whats going to happen with Knight A but he seems to be in serious SHIT! stay tuned for next week still have to leave everybody the teaser from Last week!

Alright folks, this week is going to seem a little tricky. First off Knight A is on a hunted list that consists of 1000+ characters that are hunted within the first 5-10 minutes of logging in. So that being said, I will either have to watch him like a hawk, or completely disband him grinding and set him up for protecting. Either or I will decide by tomorrow, going to see the heat of the situation today and go from there. Hope everyone had a great weekend, and welcome to week 6! Sorry again for slacking on last weeks teaser so here it is! And hopefully If I get it together another one for the end of the week &gt;;D<br />
<br />
Plans with the woman for tonight so I'll be shutting off the boys shortly giving them a rough 12~ hour day, will post updates in the morning and hope everyone has a good night.<br />
<br />
Side note; Knight A will be taken out of the rotation as I have already found a solid replacement with full blessings as well, RIP Knight A you were always my favorite &lt;3<br />

A little bit of a late start today, didn't update till early this morning but the boys have been grinding since the afternoon. B &amp; D are going to finish off their grind, then when I wake up I'll flip A2 &amp; C into their shoes and see how the new A2 fits his role. Sorry for the late update guys been a busy week so far, hopefully I can get in a few more screenshots tomorrow!<br />

Dang, not the best day yesterday was in the middle of a ranked game and my alarms start going haywire, while trying to play another game and survive from a crazed 90~ Master busting my balls I finally decide to let him die and atleast win one game. After re-blessing and setting him back to work I pass the master with his new shiny red skull on the way home, I wave and continue back to the cave. Later at night while passed the fck out I half wake up to being ganked by 3, look up half dazed and consider it a worthy death for a few more hours of sleep. Leaving two total deaths, I still get to keep my gear, my loot and leave them with nothing but a bot kill. The end of Week 6, not as good of a week as I had hoped for but a little more towards my PK bank, almost time to start power leveling my hunted mage to start fcking up these fools in my cave. Stay tuned for next week and have a great weekend guys.</div></div><hr />

Alright! Here ya go Wordies~ Update for Week 6, started slacking a little, I looked back and noticed I must of also missed week 5 totals as well after I got hunted on my favorite knight A, Ill try and get back into that habit, the weekly totals look a lot cleaner to me and a very quick easy way to see if the entire week was profittable and by how much. Hope everyone is enjoying my thread!<br />

Not bad numbers this week guys, wasn't going as strong as usual but the numbers are still there and that is what counts. I had a little set back with getting hunted to moving into my new script, either A2 needs to catch up quickly, or I might have to play around with the rotation and get these boys hunting something a little more difficult and hopefully more profitable. Have a great weekend guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">11-25-2012, 21:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Wordies, sorry If that didn't answer your question. Every week is a little different depending on how much time I actually put in myself setting up the bots, making sure they set up after SS to get in a full days time. I do it as I feel because I am not in great need of cash, but if they were running 24/7 Id assume in 6 weeks I would be in around the 3-4 Million mark. Right now going half speed as I am doing, I am averaging 300K/week it seems some better, some worse but if you multiply that by 6 ( for weeks ) you will get an average of 1.8 million made so far, hope this shed a little more light on how your bots will turn out.<br />

The server that I play on is controlled, so when I goto pg an unguilded mage, I will have 5-10 people hunting me within first 10-15 minutes of being online which makes the game very interesting/fun/souring all at the same time ;p hope it was a good weekend for ya hells~ take care man,<br />

Many internet disconnections yesterday, I had bought my father a present for his birthday to fix his internet connection, it seems now the devices are only conflicting with eachother and causing more than one headache. Thankfully the bots didn't die from any of these kicks but the profit yesterday was terrible, I even considered skipping a day and adding on to tomorrows total but here it is, not even a half day and probably 3 internet kicks. Hopefully Day 29 will be much better, the brother is home today so I may be having to spend most of my time with router//internet issues.</div></div><hr />

Ok! Slightly pissed about yesterday, not to mention the internet dropped right in the middle of a PvP Ranked Draft pick game, thank god I fixed the net, came back into the game and my teammates were doing their fucking jobs. Still took a win and we continue our 11 straight win streak. Back to Tibia! The boys have been rotated and hopefully pull a little more weight then yesterday. Now I will actually look into Orc Fortress later today when I have fixed these problems. Hope everyone is having a good week.<br />

Can anyone guess what present I bought for myself this week? Went and turned it in, will take screens later =)<br />
<br />
Well the total profit didn't turn out too bad, but I was quite pissed I was packing the boys up and the alarms go off right as Im turning off the cavebot, I decide to poke both of them with both of my knights to push em away then Ill run to town at my own leisure pace, after their white skulls had faded, they caught up with utani gran hur and were able to attack me and only take yellow skulls, I lured them from town to town about 3 cities later one of them dies to a higher level that stumbles upon me stuck in a 3 man trap. I juxus maximus out of the trap and toss on a time ring to make it back towards Ab'dendriel, make a few more ladder bounces before the entire crew shows up again, I say fuck it, turn off heals and accept the PvP death, thanks for wasting an hour of my time you dick heads and enjoy the no loot, so recieve the Twist of Fate pilgrim and get the fuck back to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for the follow Ven~ To be honest I had thought Hells was a guy the entire time, I must of not done my homework or been too stoned to be paying attention to minor details. I would love to get a team up and going, it seems on my server a team of 4-5 are able to give the top dog guild troubles with low lvl mages, it is quite funny to see the shit talk in the forums to be honest. If you and hells don't have any problems Im sure we could work something out and start up a small team for shits and giggles, on my server I have the money to support our habits, If we switch to your server I could use a minor loan to get up and started, but would always be another fun project to record ^.- Hope everyones enjoying this week, and sorry for the lack of pictures have been seriously slacking as of late! <br />

I do wonder who Venerelx is... Too many old friends coming back to my world when I can't even login! <br />
<br />
I noticed you retired knight A because it was hunted? Only saw this on the first post, no actual explaination of such events. Sucks if a botknight is that hunted! I'd just let them take black skull and keep botting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
@Hells Ouch four hour farm! Me and my RL Cousin were hunting the Dryad Event and he found a flower wreath and rubbed it in my face, minute later I killed a wisp and found moon bp rubbed it right back in his face ;p And yes, I believe in around day 22~ I posted what had happend.. Knight A got trapped and was about to lose his blessings, I had to kill him myself to prevent that, doing that got him hunted by people who can take more counts than you can think of and is on a hunted list of more than 1000+ people that get killed within first 10-15 minutes of being logged in, so retired for less grief/troubles on my end. ( He will make a great protector &gt;;D )  Also those items are from the new area they released in August, the Gnome shtuff ;p<br />

Nah I only rotate the equipment when the character runs out of stamina and is time to pass off his trusty weapon to the next boy. They paid off that gear so long ago I figure they earned it. And yes, agreed Hells most of the time, and pouring over it to make sure you did not miss a single name or thing related to your character. So I like to take daily updates and then with the Teasers I can pour over only a few pictures to make sure I did not miss one thing 100% I hope everyone is enjoying I keep saying Im going to switch up the scripts but Honestly I keep getting busy / rl shit to do so I apologize for my laziness but bear with me, I will one day flip these guys into another script, but maybe I just &lt;3 the money.<br />

<br />
Not a terrible haul! With the extra four hours I probably would of made a bit more coin but honestly I wasn't too worried just glad that everyone survived all the kicks especially while I was wandering Orc Fort. Great work boys, one more day and lets call it a week.<br />

Alright well I finally got off my ass to do a little exploring! Good news is I made it all the way out there :D Bad news, either the Test Server is to blame or somebody DDoS'd Tibia today and caused a ton of lag, nearly died while exploring ( Meaning I lose free blessings forever ) got a little bit of an adrenaline rush and parked my Knight. I will finish the script at a later date and soon you can look forward to seeing some new loots!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, not here for any form of sympathy or pity, but It is one reason I continue this project. I was in a decent car accident and am just in rehabiliation / recovery. I can't seem to sit and play for long hours at a time, so I have the boys do it for me. Hope your project started up well if you had the time Wordies, thanks for the catch up/follow.</div></div><hr />

Ok, Today is going to be tough. For one I passed out early last night so the bots saved up a little stamina, but now we have two sets of knights at half stam. I need to rotate the knights half way through the day, physiotherapy, doctors, and christmas shopping/girlfriend birthday shopping fml. All I can hope for is a day of peace, crossing my fingers and back to work ya god damn slackers.<br />
<br />
Side note; Girl later tonight when she is off work, will be only a ~10-12 hour day.<br />

Hope everyone had a good week, here it was quite quiet only a few attacks here and there but every single one was dodged which made the week a little less stressful without all the alarms! Only one teaser this week just to give everyone a sneak peak which direction this thread is headed to, don't expect it to happen next week but now that I have fully explored and deemed which area profitable it is only a matter of when I get the free time to finish the last half of the script.

<br />
the reason why i asked is because it's the same thing i started playing tibia again, i had surgery on both shoulders and im also in recovery and i needed something to kill my time with. well my project didnt start up yet, cant seem to get myself to read all the tutorials to make a decent script with depositer and such, but once i'll get the hang of it it will work out fine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">12-09-2012, 18:23</div></div><div class="posttext">Trial and error really my friend, but yes a little bit of reading and comparing your script you wrote with someones more advanced script. And I know what you mean by something to kill time with, I have nothing but time.. Im sorry to hear about the surgery, I know it sucks and fortunately myself the neuro-surgeon deemed me to young for surgery and thinks it will heal of its own accord in time ( Thank god for being young and muscles healing faster ) So I play the waiting game and do my exercises and such daily, physiotherapy weekly and I still find myself with too much time so I keep my eyes on the bots, play my mains, play some guitar, take a nap, take a walk, go to the hot tub, water-walk, stretch, heat-pack, play other games while bots are running :P Everything seems to keep me pretty busy but about 50% of my time is dedicated to therapy. I hope everyone is having a great weekend, have to run out for the girls birthday tonight and a sleep over but the boys should be running by afternoon tomorrows, take care my friends.<br />

Wow, terrible day I ask for a day of peace and quiet and get the complete opposite, Alarms every few hours, 3 completed PK attempts, 3 Dodged PK attempts, with the winter &quot;holydays&quot; coming up I think this will be the last week before I shut it down for the christmas Holidays and with the kids being off school and having nothing better to do other then PK my bots Id rather spend this extra time wisely, will see how rest of week goes and will be determined, hope everyone had a good start to their week.</div></div><hr />

Ok hopefully today goes better, I took out the higher level bot because It seemed like he was getting picked on, lost a few levels last night and raged about it this morning, thank god for blessings or dieing to that level twenty might of hurt a little more ;) Atleast I got a full sleep and will keep going through the week, stay tuned!<br />

Just tallying up the short week, I have a feeling this may be it for the holidays guys, with everyone coming back on to play Tibia for the Holidays I don't think I feel like dealing with all the PKs and such, I may use this valuable time to train my mains or gain a few extra levels with all this income &gt;;D Hope everyone had a great week and enjoy the numbers!<br />

<br />
Not terrible for a short week including 3 huge waste deaths while I wasn't paying attention but lets look past that and enjoy the sweet smell of money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Main RP ; New Mount, New Gear! <br />
<br />
Alt Knight ; New Outfit , New Mount! EPIC skills, Almost 95/90! <br />
<br />
2 New Scripts &amp; 1 Modified Script!<br />
<br />
And tons of shiny Christmas Pixels!<br />
<br />
These are my main accounts and only what I funnel my gold into, these are all played manually and pour my hard work into these fellows, and especially with free blessing week we may have some new stars coming out to shine.<br />
<br />
Only a little tease to get you guys interested for the new year, take care my friends &lt;3 <br />
<br />
Edit; Id like to say with great sorrow the Orc Fort isn't as good/great as I thought It could be. Even while sharing I was getting around a 50 potion waste after 6~ hours. This is terrible compared to my previous cash&amp;loot per hour script so I regret to say there wont be much new news in the New Year minus a few new shiny pixels.<br />

<br />
Welcome back friends &amp; Happy new year. Changing the teams up a little B will now be teamed with C due to closer levels/skills and may still be transferred to the &quot;NEW&quot; Orc Fort script I had deemed unworthy over the holidays.. but the Old &amp; Used backpack keeps calling my name, I may have to switch just to obtain this one item one day in the future. Hope everyone had great Holidays and lets get these boys back to work!<br />
<br />
Edit; Also a little surprise.. Its been awhile since we've heard about Knight E&amp;F I lost a little bit of interest in botting these two around page 4~ with having getting attacked and threatened. Well I will be continuing Knight E until 75/80~ so he will be able to wield the Avenger and make good use of his 95~ Swording. So, without further adieu Knight E shall make a re-appearance in the New Year.<br />
<br />
Edit2; Damn internet drop in the middle of the night, it seems we got atleast 4~ solid hours out of them though, flipped them back on as soon as I woke up nearly around noon many hours later.<br />

One of my shiny new pixels I got during December, voila.. my Dragonling.<br />
<br />
Well that wasn't a terrible day, I included the half day I did at Orc Fort during the Holidays, it was roughly ~10k gold and probably another ~10k in Loot but the waste was almost keeping up with the gain so I stopped and just totalled it into a complete day with the boys. Stay tuned for the short week !</div></div><hr />

Edit: ''... to avoid all the PKing/Annoyance for the next few days ...'' Just got to that part, so PvP it is! :)<br />
<br />
It damn sucks that community here is dead and there's barely any replies here. I've been around &lt;insert bot name here&gt; forums, but I gave it a thought, maybe I should open a project here to promote BlackD and stuff since BlackD is my main bot, just because I don't play Tibia regularly.<br />
<br />

Thank you very much man, and yes got to be PvP nothing is better then Tibia PvP where your heart races and you are ready to flip tables. I really wish I could record some of the things I have done to protect these boys, I have had so many pk adventures due to these brave souls. Thanks for the follow, Id be interested in seeing how you would lay out your project! Starting to slowly rally up a pk team on my main server, The server is very controlled so I have to be low key.<br />
<br />
Happy new year Provocate, good to see you around and you would be surprised. The BlackD forum has really been firing back up.<br />

Well, I usually say no botting on Fridays, but with the exception of free blessings I am making money no matter how many times I die and levels I lose are not cared as long as bank is made. And as a little side note to myself this will be the last day of Week 10! Holy this project has flown by, I hope everyone has enjoyed the screens, the memories as much as I have.<br />
<br />
Edit ; Not too bad for the day got about ~8 hours in without being disturbed, woman again for the night will post pictures/numbers in the morning. Have a great weekend folks! &lt;3 and that is the end of Week 10!<br />

<br />
Not a great haul for the boys, but I had woken up quite late with the girl, started the bots and took them down early Id be lucky to say they got a full 6-7 hours which was a little bit of slacking on my part but I had some RL stuff to deal with in the new year.

Well, hopefully its a little more tame during the day, woke up to one death in the morning but Free Blessings, lost a little bit of experience and gained enough to make it worth while, will continue right until SS.<br />

I do not have to farm for 14+ hours just to play my main, I have the boys do it for me and play my main when I have the chance. Thanks for the follow, my suggestions are as such. Create a entirely seperate account that you are off loading your money to. Either keep that your main or bank and just keep the &quot;Cavebot&quot; function off from that account and you should be entirely safe and sound. Make FACCs, and farm em to death, wish you luck Alex and let me know how it is going or even start your own thread for people to follow the progess =)<br />

We like to see baby projects so they can grow! We had a 1-300 on blackdproxy before. <br />

But anyways with Free Blessing ending tomorrow at ss I will stop botting so hard because the pking/defending will begin &gt;;D and yes Santanas project was a very interesting read! Got to love memories like that. <br />
<br />
@Hells Glad to hear your still watching. Hopefully school gets a little easier on you. Thanks for the props, I don't wait I go round and round and sell it all, little time consuming but I do it with a coffee in the morning and by the time I am done I am awake enough to start my morning routine =) Usually I cash out at the end of every week on NPC Loot, but I saved up probably 1.5~ weeks worth and had a little bit of my main npc loot to turn in. Was a nice combined effort from the boys &gt;;D<br />
<br />
@Viewers ; I really am glad to see everyone enjoying the figures and even inspiring some folk to start their own projects. I would love feed back on how you would lay out your income/earnings. We are growing rapidly it seems and I love to see all the teamwork that has come together in the BlackD community as of late Thanks for your help guys.</div></div><hr />

I suggest you only pick up NPC Loot / Gold, I find the more high capacity loot you pick up the more deposits / less experience and honestly, that garbage loot is made in gold very quickly. Just a thought my friend!<br />

Alright, this has been a long week so I guess it is a little expected. Cipsoft shut down their servers last night after the boys were running for MAYBE ~30 minutes. I guess they knew I was goin a little too hard this week ;p gonna put the boys back on now that I am up and hopefully get maybe ~12 hours in before the girl shows up tonight.<br />

Just a few shiny pixels I have achieved lately!<br />
<br />
Numbers weren't as great as I had hoped, but Failsofts fault and took down the servers right after I had finished setting everything up, resumed in the morning but only for roughly 7.5 hours until my girl showed up. Due to the end of free blessing week, I believe I will resume back to regular schedule and end on a good note.</div></div><hr />

Your Inbox is full this message was supposed to be delivered to you in response to your pm.<br />
<br />
I pre-fill up my bots, 200~ manas, 400~ Brown mushrooms. I run depositers and waypoints. Thats basically it. When it comes to pre-cautions, I do not use any script that is not my own, I do not run any form of mana buyer/spear re-fillers. <br />
<br />
I use the very basic commands of blackD. Auto-eat, Conditionals, and Cavebot for Move commands, and Iftruemycap, putLootonDepot etc.<br />
<br />
Hah that is a very good dream my friend, I always wanted that myself it would take a lot of preperation and teamwork/skype. Good luck starting bud, let me know If I can help in any way.<br />

Well, I got a little lazy, I was going to round up all the loot and sell that too but I think that will be Mondays first teaser. This is the balance of two days approx ~1.5 days of the new script I have written. It seems to do pretty well and very quiet which is what I prefer over more xp is solitude. Come Monday you will see what all the NPC Loot made and than I will add the plus' and the minus' Hope every has a great weekend and enjoyed Week 12. Totals will be posted shortly.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't justify only selling two days of loot and saying hey look! Its almost as good as my other script. Well I figured I will give the teaser of the loot next week, this teaser here includes all loot, made by the boys and by my mains when I like to play by hand. I turned it in for a whopping over half a million, turned around and spent it all on some shiny pixels ;) This loot was totalled for roughly one week of work from both parties included.<br />

There is an amplifier behind each seat, the JBL is 1000w powering both 10&quot; Kicker Competition subs and the Alpine is 376W Digital powering all of my Alpine speakers (fronts&amp;backs) more to come in the next few days! Stay tuned ;)<br />

Off to my tutor/physiotherapy so I am quickly just posting numbers and restarting the boys before I am out for the day!<br />
Had the girl sleep over and woke up early, hoping the boys get a good 16+ Hours in today to make up for some of the money I have spent recently.<br />
<br />
Edit ; Sorry for the large pictures, it seems to count the extra large pictures as two, I may have problems uploading again tomorrow.<br />

Off to a terrible start, rotated and started the boys after SS and then probably not even 2-3 hours of time spent before they both got pked! Ouch, waking up to two twist of fates that really sucks, blessed and back to work folks.<br />

To be honest atleast the cash paid off the blessings I had paid for in the morning, I got attacked several more times to the point I had just turned off the bot for a while here and there so I really do not know how much time they both used since each died at different points in time during the day. I am going to say since these blessings have wore off people seem to be back into pking again and I need to be more vigilant in defending the boys. Hopefully tomorrow brings a good last day to the end of the week!</div></div><hr />

Well I slept all the way till and through SS last night so I will start up the boys in a few hours when they have enough stamina to run for half a day, got the girl later so only going to be a 10-12 hour haul today folks, hope everyone has had a good week and enjoyed my thread!<br />

<br />
Not a terrible haul for the boys, seems I had someone a little upset at my boys farming this week, had several pk attempts, a few of them ended up being sucessful because I was either completely AFK and or too busy hunting intense shit with my main to give a damn. I have a goal in mind and I want to see these FACCs reach level 100~ and I am done this project with my Free Knights. I have been working on something new and hopefully after I finish up this project I will probably take a short break and maybe start a new project which I would love some ideas/input on. Hope everyone had a great week and enjoy your weekend!<br />

Welcome to Week 14 The boys are up bright &amp; early!<br />
<br />
Edit; Had a very bad day yesterday for my back, was quite laid up to the point I had to sleep, as the story goes the two boys were both pked as I slept soundly &amp; drugged out, that cost me an easy ~14K each death which basically made the income of today next to none.<br />

<br />
Having a little bit of frustration at Tibia / Real-life issues this week so as far as it goes botting my FACCs I think this week is going to be paused. I hope everyone has enjoyed my thread so far and hopefully in a ~week I will get back to business. I am having some thoughts on stopping and start a fresh thread on characters I use that are a little more protected/well equipped to bot at a leisurely pace. Any input/suggestions from an outside perspective would be nice.<br />

I got them done yesterday and have been quite stiff/sore so I am continuing the postponement for another while if not permanently, I have looked into a few courses and a tutor so may be a little to busy with real life to continue updating/taking screenshots on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

Edit; I will not be quitting Tibia, and this may even open up a little more time for me to play my mains/alts manually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Botting on a full-time scale and or bringing BlackD onto your premium accounts to allow auto-eat, auto-heals, auto ammo-refill(for pala) is the next step of Tibia. It allows you to hunt/pk at a much more experienced level.<br />
<br />
A few suggestions I like to start with, are learn the bot. Before running this on your main account , try making acouple free accounts and bot a few knights to main. Honestly knights are the only thing this caveBot is really good at. I say caveBot because blackD Proxy is so much more than just a bot, the only thing I find or concerns me is running Cavebot on my main premium accounts, I still to this day have not had any bans once I started creating and making my own scripts. I find running others scripts when you are not aware of what packets it may/may not send with their fastExiva &gt; strings may/may not get you banned. I tend to simple scripts with just move commands and a simple depositer of gold/items at the end of the script and have him pre-stocked with enough food / potions to last an entire 24/hrs of botting. Start browsing the forums, learn the ways and make a few of your own scripts, use other peoples scripts as references to make sure your on the right track! PM me if you have any questions yourself or even reply in here, hopefully I answered any questions you may of had.<br />

<br />
On a side note I will be looking into a secondary project but not with the same upkeep as this one, maybe on a week basis I will upload the stats. Will be forming a new team and probably creating a brand new thread sometime in the future, for now I will have to appease my loyal fans with some of my adventures of Tibia.<br />

I have got one team fully operational to bot on a full-time basis. Although I will not be using them full-time the option is always open. I just wanted to say thank you again for everyones support and advice through my project. It had allowed me to keep my mind occupied and play my main with some serious funding. Now that I have achieved most of everything I need in Tibia in this short time 55~ Days I will be letting these freebies go, and hopefully starting a fresh project within the next few weeks, take care my friends.<br />

<br />
Thank you I am glad you enjoyed it ! Unfortunately I thought about that for a bit that I might give them out but I dont think people will use them properly and will lose their blessings etc. I will use these chars to visit Santa on a yearly basis, Or to trap some high lvls in between two solid high level knights while I pk them on the outsides with two mages/sioing my walls. So the answer is no, Even though I have 50 accounts It was well worth it in the long run &gt;;D Hopefully I get the umph to restart soon enough I have been having too much fun PKing as of late!<br />
<br />
ps ; Blackd isn't too good at botting a mage, but I could easily get one to 45 just offline training his ml and botting him in a rot cave with a sword making runes ;) Always a good suggestion for a pk char.<br />

<br />
It seems BlackD got very detectable even while playing on my two main premiums for auto-heals and such, I received the big ban hammer on ONLY my two main accounts, losing uncountable amounts of stuff but, I wanted to show the fun times I had while using BlackD not only to just BOT but to play the game, tank things that would of been impossible, kill people with two screens at once using exiva mcit exiva kill &quot;PLAYERNAME&quot; // exiva mcit exiva +0PLAYERNAME which would auto combo SDs/Wands. This tool made me ULTIMATE when it came to Tibia, I wish that Blackd had stuck around, the community was re-building and I was learning of a many key new tricks on Tibia and Blackd, so here are to my memories of Tibia &amp; BlackD.<br />

U have done really well out of this good for u. Just wondering where u were hunting and if will give out the script</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">04-10-2013, 04:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, due to BlackD being very detectable within the last couple of patches and my main and secondary main accounts getting banned I completely uninstalled the D and removed all my scripts figured it was time to restart legit.<br />
<br />
Some key areas I found very worthwhile to start botting.<br />
<br />
Rook ; Keep it simple, don't leave town Rats were my first script but my second script I included Bugs/Trolls/Poision Spiders after acquiring a full Rookgard Set.<br />
<br />
Main ; I was a an old Tibian player from back in Nova. When I restarted a while back and began to bot I selected Thais. I am totally ashamed to say, but Venore is a must. <br />
<br />
Venore Main Low Levels ; Swamp Trolls ( Great loot and money made from Medicine Pouches ) <br />
<br />
Venore Amazon Camp ; Even at a low level with a decent healing conditional and a good loop you will make fistfuls of money in Creature loot and have chances of Bags of Apple Slices and Witch Hats and if you are very lucky a Stuffed Toad.<br />
<br />
After doing Swamp Trolls till about 15-20 Depending on how good your gear is you can move onto Amazons and Valkyries and Witches and start creating some bank and the goal here is to hit a good level of 30 at the Amazon Camp and some skills to take on a little harder creatures.<br />
<br />
Moving onto Ab'dendriel ; Why Ab? Because this route is my god damn favorite that's why. <br />
<br />
Thais Undead Cave ; Accessible from Ab'dendriel as well, but the main point is there is less foot traffic and people to mess around with you if you are actually AFK. The depot seems to be very inactive and little to none hostility/people fucking with your bot &amp; depositer. I scripted what was do-able for my character, always kept food on eat and over 150 manas for the day, once my knights were a decent set of skills they ate nothing but food and wasted manas only due to pks. Here I pulled in the most of my cash in my botting career. I would play this area till your Knight is lvl 85-90 and a very good set of skills.<br />
<br />
Staying at Ab'dendriel ; Why? Because like before It is a nice an quiet depot. From here we will head to the Orc Fort, where we will try and acquire a few rares and Sam's Old Backpack. I recommend farming Orc Fort from 90-120~ Then consider tackling POH but this was as far as my main Knight had made it before retiring on this project. <br />
<br />
I thank everybody for the support and messages it was very fun and I am sad to go but alas I fear to say it but time to play legit.<br />

Also please note all these scripts have a depositor but NOT a refiller because all my characters were blessed and had twist of fate and enough supplies to last them a full 24/h of botting. <br />

Sorry I did not release these sooner and thank you to everyone who took the time to post and enjoy this thread and project as much as I had creating it.

This bot I have switched to doesn't inject into the Tibia Client, it does not send packets and uses keyboard and mouse clicks making it one of the safest bots out there ( No bot is completely safe, most people believe that it takes either bad packets or a ton of reports to get the ban hammer ) As I was never a fan of using any refillers or sending any unwanted packets this seemed to be the perfect fit for me... Below I am going to post a few pictures of the progress I have had within the last couple of weeks with this new Bot and leave some feedback if you like what you see! I am already currently recording my progress on the other Bots website as my second project ( This one being my first ) so I wont take too much time to reply here too often but I just wanted everyone to see I am back in business and flourishing! Below are some pictures I hope you guys like! Without further adieu I present... Lithium 101 Better, Stronger.. Faster then before!<br />

Hopefully you all enjoy these pictures, I decided to update this thread because this is where I initially started my first project recording my EXP/Profit with my characters and being a loyal member of the BlackD community I wanted everyone to know I still miss using BlackD and talking to everyone in the BlackD community!<br />
<br />
*I would also like to add the pictures above is of all the EXP/Loot/Profit made in a SINGLE day of botting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">09-12-2014, 03:16</div></div><div class="posttext">EK Loot ... Day 2 Recorded (Below is a picture of all the loot from a single day of botting, I usually don't layout all the loot nicely like this because the HUD shows all the loot collected and waste and then after calculating the waste shows your actual PROFIT, but this is just an example of how much loot he actually collects in a single day!)<br />
<br />

<br />
This picture coincides with the HUD from &quot;EK ... Day 2&quot; in a reply above and just shows the horde of loot he collected in a single day, also in the picture above he is missing the 53 Spider Silk that was recorded on the HUD from &quot;EK ... Day 2&quot; and that is only because I was selling it while the prices were skyrocketed and didn't want to miss out on selling it at a greater than usual price.<br />
<br />
Enjoy, hope everyone in the BlackD Community is doing well and I will periodically post here from time to time when I have a decent few pictures to upload of my progress, feel free to leave any questions/concerns and I will try and get back to them as soon as possible. Stay tuned for the next week of progress!</div></div><hr />

*AbEliteUndead2 and AbUndead2 were the main two scripts that were used throughout this entire project! They are two seperate scripts with different waypoints on each of them because I had 2 separate Knights using these scripts at the same time bringing in as much profit as possible.</div></div><hr />

These scripts are strictly CONDITIONALs, Mainly used for HEALING and using POTIONS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">09-12-2014, 04:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, that is EVERYTHING that I still had after two years of no longer using BlackD, I am going to assume 99% of those scripts STILL work and should Deposit when they are low on capacity (You might have to edit a certain line in the .txt that says when capacity is below &lt;N goto scriptline XX only edit the &lt;N to the number of cap you want him to go back to deposit). I wrote all of these scripts MYSELF and I am going to state again that if some of these scripts are no longer working I will not be editing them as I no longer use BlackD Tools but the two main scripts that were used for nearly this entire project and made me a ton of cash/loot were AbUndead2 and AbEliteUndead2 which completely differ in waypoints as I was running them on two separate knights so they weren't walking the exact same path, you will have to decide for yourself which is the better script if you only plan on using one of the two, or to make mad cash like I was run one each on two different Knights! <br />
<br />
Again, I will not be editing these scripts and if you feel like adjusting/fixing these yourself then feel free, but none of these scripts REFILL Manas/Health Potions but almost all of them DO have a Depositer. I will ask although I no longer use these scripts I would ask politely that you do not edit these scripts and then re-post and take credit for them, If you are going to fix these up and decide to re-post these scripts then please at the very least make it well-known that I was responsible for creating it and give me credit where credit is due. Thanks again all, and good luck using BlackD!<br />
<br />
For anyone just visiting this thread for the first time in quite some time and remember me from a few years back, please scroll back a couple of pages ( 18~? ) and take a look at some of my recent pictures of my exp/h profit/h that I posted today! Enjoy everyone I hope that these scripts or this project gives you some inspiration!<br />
