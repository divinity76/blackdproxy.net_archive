The problem is, I do not know how to script it D: It is so much easier when you're just depositing in main, but on Rookgaard you can't deposit more than 2k gold and sometimes I get more of that. 
 
Anyway, it'd look like this:

sayInTrade change gold<br />
waitX 2<br />
sayInTrade ??<br />
waitX 2<br />
sayInTrade yes<br />
<br />
?? = what do I do here so it will exchange gold coins into platinum coins?<br />
<br />
For example if I got '22:22 Using one of 1492 gold coins...'<br />
<br />
It seems impossble! :(:(:(</div></div><hr />
