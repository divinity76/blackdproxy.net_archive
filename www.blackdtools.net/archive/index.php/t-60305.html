<br />
1 account deleted! Only account I've been using for the past month or two. And I just set it botting yesterday for no more than 2 hours lmao. More below. \/<br />
<br />
I've made a cavebot script yesterday on Rookgaard. Very, very basic stuff: waypoints, setMeleeKill, setLootOff. Botted for 2 hours, then logged off. No one was there, so no one could report me. I didn't go AFK, was at the computer all the time.<br />
<br />
Today I've received the deletion. I don't know if there were any errors like @679alex is saying, I didn't check Proxy logs, just because nothing went wrong, script was running flawlessly.<br />
<br />
I'll post screenies of my account page, if some might be in doubts that this is fake.</div></div><hr />

Anyway someone reported some bad packets blackd was sending a few days ago - so blackd should be safer once those are fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was checking through my list of accounts and I came across two more accounts that were deleted today. (So 3 in total, out of 3 :|).<br />
<br />
But this one is rather funny lol. Last time I logged on those 2 accounts was on 25th of March 2013. A MONTH (!!!) ago. And I was only botting through Rookgaard, haven't logged on since lmao.<br />
<br />
Seems like BlackD Proxy is VERY detectable. It must be something in the bot itself. Oh well I knew the risk was there, so no problem.<br />
<br />
But anyway, I guess I won't use BlackD at all from now on. :| Not even on these moneymaking accounts, since it sucks to get deleted on levels from 40-50 in every banwave. :&#8364;</div></div><hr />

I forgot to check.. I've been banned on 40 knight and 2 lvl 25~ which I hadn't used since last banwave so I don't really understand why they got banned now...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This account has been banished from Tibia because of repeated lesser rule violations or a single very severe rule violation. The account will be deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't logged on for at least 2 months and according to Tibia.com news archive there were at least 2 ban waves in the meanwhile, on 27th of February and 15th of March.<br />
<br />
This means that they're also deleting accounts from months ago when those were caught botting, right? At least that's how I understand it.<br />
<br />
I mean dafuq?! Haven't logged since, 2 ban waves in between and then deleted on the 3rd one even thought inactive. o.o Yikes!</div></div><hr />
