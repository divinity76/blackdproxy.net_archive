	<meta name="description" content="I was reading some forums and some guy was talking about big amounts of money being made making breads in Thais (buying wheat for 1gp each, making the bread and selling for 2gp each) 
He said he spend 70k in wheat and made 140k selling breads. 
Okay. that's kinda impossible that 2 guys make 70k breads in a day, even with the bot. 
 
That made me think: there's some alternative ways of getting money in tibia? Even if it sounds impossible/hard to do, like that example that i quoted.

Something like resell things, buy cheaper and sell high.<br />
I used to buy 1k death runes in Runescape for 250k, and sell back for 300k =p<br />
There's something like that in Tibia's NPCs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make bot knights free acc/prem acc doesn't matter and just put them out on diffrent spots to farm gold. at first there wont be that much gold but as they gain levels the profit gets bigger.<br />
<br />
And at your last question about reselling. Well you can always try to buy djinn/rashid items of the market cheaper and sell it to the npc, but as this is already a common thing to do you might not earn to much doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same with premium scrolls. BUY THEM ALLL and resell. Monopoly is legal</div></div><hr />

yea i'm actually botting some characters on a 7.72 server<br />
but i'm talking about ALTERNATIVE ways of earning money =p<br />
<br />
@xHellsx<br />
that's pretty boss, but the cons is that you need the money<br />
<br />
any more ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">11-06-2012, 19:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Hells basically gave you the main money making principle in Tibia and it even applies to RL you need Money to Make money. Start as Razoor suggested, Follow my thread in the screen shots &amp; videos forum about my Money Making thread and you will start to see what Razoor was talking about. Put this income towards items that people want or have on EVERY char? By what do you mean on every char? Think about it here is one example I will not spoon feed you everything. Sorcs = Yalahari Mask, Paladins = Yala Legs<br />
<br />
Catch the drift and you will make millions.<br />
