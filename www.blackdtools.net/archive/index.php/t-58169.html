Anyone know if the bot turns off if the screen gets black or anything common. 
I hope this problem gets solved because its very annoying. 
I have to turn the screen off, or atleast have the screensaver on because else it gets to bright in my room :cool: 
 
Thanks in advance

No, its not bot fault. If u bot in day and nothing wrong happens it should work fine in night too. So maybe its becouse of your internet connetion, sometimes network providers reboot connetion in nights. <br />
Or maybe its becouse of your PC power supply settings. Try to bot in day throught few hours without using PC.</div></div><hr />

Yes thats right, i've tried to bot in daylight for a few hours and that worked just fine. But not at night, actually my friends has the same problem. And i have been online at nights before when exping manually ofc.. and that has been no problem either.<br />
So its for sure something strange.</div></div><hr />

You don't get kicked at server reset with message &quot;server reset&quot; it says &quot;connection lost~&quot; but if your sure it isn't server reset then it is just your computer going into standby, or your internet provider rebooting your connection or such</div></div><hr />

Your computer has turned into standby ofc connection will be lost. Just turn that option off inside power options or personal settings if desktop</div></div><hr />
