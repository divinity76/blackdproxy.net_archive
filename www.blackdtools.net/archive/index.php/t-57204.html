 I used to play with tibiabot and elfbot. I have been looking around, and as it seems there are only two bots up and running. Blackd and TibiaAuto.  
 
Is the Tibiabot site down or are just my internet being a bitch?  
 
i have been trying to get NeoBot and Ghostbot too. but it just seems they wont work. 
 
Annyone know what has been happening? In just a year 4 Different bots have gone down?

<br />
actually, he stopped developing it because canadian laws changed and made it illegal somehow.<br />
<br />
And zensas, there indeed has been quite a many bot shut downs but a few i know are xenobot (not sure if released yet), redbot and ofc blackd.</div></div><hr />

And tibia auto just sucks in general. And the newer bots well... are to new, you never know if their putting a backdoor in these new bots to pish accounts. Play safe, Play BlackD.</div></div><hr />
