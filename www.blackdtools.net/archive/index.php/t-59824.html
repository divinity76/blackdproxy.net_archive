They can be dangerous commands, specially if you try to sell ZERO items. Client would never send such packets.  
 
From now - since Blackd Proxy 27.6 - bot will not send any trade packet to server if the amount is zero. That is why I say bot is now a bit safer. 
 
Anyways it have been proven that the people using very basic cavebot scripts were not detected. If you want to be as safe as possible" />

<br />
Anyways it have been proven that the people using very basic cavebot scripts were not detected. If you want to be as safe as possible then stick to basic scripts. <br />
<br />
Note about exiva buy / sell : they are still dangerous commands if you don't use them correctly!<br />
if you try to sell more items than what you have = you get detected = deletion in next ban wave<br />
if you try to buy more items than what you can carry = you get detected = deletion in next ban wave<br />
if you try to buy more items than what you can afford with your gold = you get detected = deletion in next ban wave<br />
<br />
You better be very carefull when using advanced commands. Never try to do something that is impossible for the Tibia client.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update: Now latest version is Blackd Proxy 27.7 because Tibia got a ninja update today (Tibia 9.81)</div></div><hr />
