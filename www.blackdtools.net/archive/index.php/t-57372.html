	<meta name="description" content="Hello! 
 
When neobot forums were online, I found and used a thread explaining how to do it, but the forums are down and I don't remember how to make independent tibia clients and make the configs (hotkeys) stay on each client. 
 
I had 8 different clients and they all saved the hotkeys each time. 
 
On C:/ there was files called: Knight, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer. And shortcuts to the desktop. When I was playing knight.exe and had hotkeys saved as knight. 
 
Cam't just remember how to do it," />

<br />
Cam't just remember how to do it, cuz on roaming, there's just one .cfg file at this point. And the hotkeys is the same on all clients.<br />
<br />
Is there any such thread here or any1 know how to do it?</div></div><hr />
