**THIS PROBLEM MUST HAVE EXPLANATIONS TO EACH STEP YOU CANNOT JUST SAY WHO YOU KNOW/THINK IT IS!!**<br />
<br />
WHO IS THE ENGINEER?<br />
      In the following puzzle, every fact is relevant and must be considered in the solution.  A train is operated by three men: Smith, Robinson, and Jones.  They are a fireman, an engineer, and a brakeman – not necessarily in that order.  On the train are three businessmen of the same names: Mr. Smith, Mr. Robinson, and Mr. Jones.<br />
<br />
1.       Mr. Robinson lives in Detroit.<br />
<br />
2.       The brakeman lives halfway between Chicago and Detroit.<br />
<br />
3.       Mr. Jones earns $26,000 a year.<br />
<br />
4.       Smith beat the fireman at billiards.<br />
<br />
5.       The brakeman’s neighbor, one of the passengers, earns three times as much as the brakeman, who earns $10,000 yearly.<br />
<br />
6.       The passenger whose name is the same as the brakeman’s lives in Chicago.<br />
<br />
Who is the engineer?</div></div><hr />

Brakeman is not Mr Robinson.<br />
Smith is not the fireman. Must be the engineer or the brakeman. Then the fireman must be either Robinson or Jones.<br />
The brakeman's neighbor is Mr Smith. Mr Jones cant be because he earns less than $30,000. And Mr Robinson lives in Detroit, so he cant be either.<br />
Mr Jones or Mr Smith lives in Chicago. But Mr Smith, being neighbours with brakeman, lives halfway between Chicago and Detroit.<br />
Hence Mr Jones lives in Chicago.<br />
So the brakeman is Jones.<br />
<br />
And from our third statement, Smith not being the fireman, nor the brakeman, must be the engineer.<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
PD I hope this makes up for last problem where I screwed it up</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">10-14-2010, 05:55</div></div><div class="posttext">This one was pretty easy, Im 10000% sure this is the correct answer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Random-j</div><div class="date">10-15-2010, 07:20</div></div><div class="posttext">My answer &quot;Again google is your friend&quot; :P<br />
<br />
1. Mr. Robinson lives in Detroit.  <br />
2.The brakeman lives exactly halfway between Chicago and Detroit.  <br />
3.Mr. Jones earns exactly $20,000 per year.  <br />
<br />
4.The brakeman&#8217;s nearest neighbor, one of the passengers, earns exactly three times as much as the brakeman.  <br />
a.Therefore the brakeman&#8217;s nearest neighbor is not Mr. Jones because Mr. Jones&#8217; salary of $26,000 per year is not a multiple of 3.<br />
  <br />
5.Smith beats the fireman at billiards.  <br />
a.Therefore the fireman is either Jones or Robinson.  <br />
<br />
6.The passenger whose name is the same as the brakeman&#8217;s lives in Chicago.  <br />
a.Therefore, since Mr. Robinson lives in Detroit and since the brakeman&#8217;s nearest neighbor (one of the passengers) is not Mr. Jones (from 4a) then Mr. Smith must be the brakeman&#8217;s nearest neighbor. <br />
b.Therefore Mr. Jones lives in Chicago. <br />
c.Therefore the brakeman&#8217;s name is Jones (from 6). <br />
d.Therefore the fireman is Robinson. (from 5a) <br />
<br />
e.Therefore the engineer is Mr Smith.</div></div><hr />
