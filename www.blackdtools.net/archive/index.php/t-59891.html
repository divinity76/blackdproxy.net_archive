<br />
I was planning on sticking to fremmy, but since I've been scripting for a friend he paid with premium scrolls so premmy scripts will begin shortly. Thais is generally my home town so I have lots of scripts around there to easily get 1 - 30 in 5 days.<br />
<br />
On another note if you have scripts with problems in feel free to share them here and I'll repost them to your specifications.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 07:37</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay so level 1-8 (and I know most of these scripts are out there but I thought I'd compile it all in one place). I tend to do a bit of manual just skip the tutorial with santiago, drop everything but your bag and fist kill sheep for meat. Full cap of meat = 60 gold, on the way back from willie stop at the hut north of the npc who buys dead animals (sorry forgotten his name) and pick up the doublet from the square just left of the grate one floor down. Continue to the weapon shop, buy a sabre, head upstairs and buy leather legs and a wooden shield. Now go down the central grate of Rook start this script and go get something to eat or play another character with multiclient. 4-8 hours later ding he logs out you're level 8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 07:45</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, we're level 8. But we got waaaay too much gold to pas the orcale, so you're gonna want to deposit all that good stuff. Now we head to the oracle, hi yes yes and boom DESTINY ISLAND! Hurrah! Head to the npc and again skip tutorial because no one wants to waste time with party skeletons :D. Choose a vocation, head downstairs grab your new badass equipment and head for the boat.<br />
<br />
If you wanna stay with me at this point you better choose Thais.<br />
<br />
So now you're all like woah I wanna afk bot but I'm way too squishy to go afk! Well think again, it's slow exp but it saves deaths later, give it one night here and we'll be good to continue.<br />
<br />
I must admit this is a script I repaired so thanks to whom so ever wrote this originally, it's good for knights and mages, just start in the depot. Make sure you've got your runemaker set up for wasting mana, we need to train magic asap! Oh and no need for hp/mana settings yet this will be easy! Mages should bear in mind full defensive should be on now for the rest of your life!<br />
<br />
Oooh and I made a little one for pallys too start it without any spears in the depot and you'll be all good!<br />
<br />
They both deposit gold in the depot too so enjoy your bank balance increase!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Re written Paladin script should buy spear up to max capacity and then refill at 2, someone test please? Yours THE HESP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so after a night on the rats we should be roughly 13-15 if we've been lucky and it's been a quiet night. Now we're think gosh I want more gold, more experience and more excitement! Well hold your horses, we should have some gold saved up so it's already time to upgrade armor and weapons, make sure you buy a rope and shovel too we'll need them to continue. So here we go, North Trolls is a great starting place for pally's and knights and we can go completely afk straight away! But i'm afraid with mages we have 2 options, either stay in the rats another day or we buy better equipment so we don't have to worry.<br />
<br />
Okay Paladins theres a little more manual work for you to do but it'll only take about 3 minutes, go to the weapon shop and buy a longsword that way the conditional script that refills your spears will work, if you know how to edit it then by all means use any weapon you want, consult Malmis for a tutorial. (http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?57409-Use-looted-Small-Stones-or-Spears-instead-of-Weapon)<br />
<br />
Load conditionals in to the tab marked &quot;?&quot; on the main Blackd window.<br />
<br />
For Pallys you wont be making much gold here, it's slow on account that the spears overfill you until you have no cap and so collecting gold must wait for you to lose a spear, it seems a knight will deposit 1000 gold every 1.5 hours and a paladin will deposit every 2 hours so its not that different. But the constant distance training is sublime!<br />
<br />
We'll stay botting here until level 25, should only take 2 consecutive nights of full afk. This time remember to set up the hp/mana settings you could take some pots as a fail safe but you should be fine I've put 5 of each vocation through this cycle this week and none have died, yet. Runemake on too to waste mana, magic level is important for all vocations!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 08:03</div></div><div class="posttext">So for our knight friends, this is where it gets fun and we start rolling in the gold real early. Wasps south of thais, average around 60 honeycombs in a 15 hour cycle just start the script south of thais, it doesn't deposit, but it wont die if you've followed my plan so far. Just remember to set runemaker and hp/mana settings and away we go. Also collects wolf paws and the rare wold trophy from the single war wolf. You can start using this from level 15, but I would advise waiting till at least 18 so there no chance of death and it becomes again 100% afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 08:07</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 20 Knights 100% afk North Rotworms, start in the depot, deposits 1000 gold at a time. Enjoy! I also included one for mages, so long as you're still using the first wand we'll be fine down here with no pots, make sure you have at least a plate set and gaurdian shield though! It uses the apprentice strike to kill poison spiders incase you're using a druid :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yorgy</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 13:30</div></div><div class="posttext">thx a lot, waiting for new scripts for mage!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 18:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Tell me what you need and I'll make it, tell me level, vocation and equipment and tell me what you want levels or money? I enjoy a challenge :D plus its my day off so I have 10 hours today. hit me back, THE HESP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yorgy</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 18:24</div></div><div class="posttext">so... Druid 22 lvl 21mlvl item platinum amulet,demon shield, b robe, boh, hat of the mad, b legs, northwind rod. Best for me will be if i do not waste money. :P <br />
<br />
EDIT: Potion buyer and depositer too if you could :) Just want to have 99% afk :)<br />
<br />
EDIT@: FACC plzz :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 18:30</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay so something I was messing with this morning for premium Paladins, we're gonna head over to Ankrahmun. Head to the boat in thais, hi venore yes, at venore boat, hi ankrahmun yes, now ask for map guide and then click on over to the depot. Now we're here we want to have some good equipment, a plate set and medusa shield is working good for me and still leaves my account balance looking nice. So level 20's we're gonna go to the first floor central larvas with a nice royal spear refiller, no pot refiller because we don't need it here :D. Just start this script in the depot. When we hit level 30 we're gonna start going down one floor to the scarabs since the larvas will only give us 12/17k exp/h and the scarabs can give us up to 25k exp/h and thats just how we roll. :P<br />
<br />
If anyone wants a knight and mage version just hit me up! :P<br />

It's venore orcs with potion buyer, loot depositor and gold depositor, can be started from the depot, if you don't have the map already mapped out I found it had to do a little run around to find the correct path but it's again totally afk just one or two shamans down there. For mages if you're using an earth rod remember to set up a fire attack to kill monsters that are immune to earth, gimme a shout if theres anything wrong with this one for mages as I have only tested it with a knight. Enjoy :)<br />

EDIT UPDATED VERSION SAME AS PAGE 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jthesp</div><div class="date">01-12-2013, 18:44</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to be a bore but it'll be a few days before I get on to 40-50 scripts, these accounts have only been going for 9 days now so it'll be day 12 when I get to 40's, sorry for the inconvenience. In the mean time I'm going to make some outfit collectors starting with Citizen, totally all encompassed so it will collect everything you need in one script (perhaps in seperate stages, not sure how it'll pan out in the end haha). Although if you need anything levels 1-30 or any script repairs link them here or give me a shout, make sure it's public though, I'm a script sharer not a seller.</div></div><hr />

The only problem I see so far is the Fibula, I really don't like running a depositer script there due to the locked door and the well, which means every single patch you have to double check those packets to see if the door or well have changed correct?

The only problem I see so far is the Fibula, I really don't like running a depositer script there due to the locked door and the well, which means every single patch you have to double check those packets to see if the door or well have changed correct? Just out of curiosity myself. <br />
<br />
Edit ; These are the things that get you landed with a ban-hammer If I would say so myself.<br />

Cheers for the feed back, nice to hear from a senior. Yea it is a problem you're right, it's correct as is for now but I'll rewrite without hex's for a safer script. :D Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

This has been brought to my attention this evening, I will repost corrected script either in the morning or in a couple of hours, depending on how long these others take me to finish. Thanks for using my scripts!<br />
<br />
Edit: I replaced the original Pally Rats script its on page 1, now should buy spears up to max capacity and refills at 2. Someone test and leave feedback please!</div></div><hr />

It loots: <br />

-Carrion Worm Fangs<br />
-Bat Wings<br />
-Wolf paws (rarely to and from the city)<br />
-those crappy bits of cloth you get from trolls<br />

This script will work nicely with the spears refiller conditional for pallys level 20+ and it works fine for knights, if mages want one please feel free to ask :D.<br />

My suggestion is for certain places like Fibula your usually there for the good EXP with mages etc, so what I like to do is just walk them there myself, have them Blessed from free blessing week of course, loaded with enough potions, brown mushrooms to cover them for the night and run the loop infinite until your stam is low. Collecting only NPC Loot and leaving gold, so you still get a decent amount of money and get the EXP constantly never leaving the cave all night long. For Fibula an example of NPC Loot would be Carrion Worm Fangs, Lump of Dirt, etc. Things that add up and are extremely light. On anything that does not require a door to open with a key or a well to go up/down I definitely use depositers! Glad to see everyone participating and helping out.<br />

When we hit level 30 we're gonna start going down one floor to the scarabs since the larvas will only give us 12/17k exp/h and the scarabs can give us up to 25k exp/h and thats just how we roll. :P<br />

<br />
That said, would it be possible to get a quick and easy script for edron rots that runs down east side hole and moves to 2nd/3rd/4th floors with carrions while not going back to first floor? world i'm on doesn't really have anyone farming edron rots seemingly ever since i always find it empty and that would be a huge help to me. If you could throw in a script for auto deposit /sell of dirt/fangs i'd appreciate that more than anything as i could probably do the coord's for the fight path myself but am completely lost on the sell/deposit idea. <br />

If you can help me out that would be great but no real rush, I know you get alot of requests and I don't wanna make your life harder ;) . I appreciate the help in advance  <br />

All in all great scipts. My pally is now moving on toward lvl 35 and was hoping to see what scripts you may have for me as i level.

Scripts used:<br />
Ank Scarabs<br />

Edit: Thought of another idea maybe a mana potion buyer for scarabs because i found i could start hunting there quite early if i used potions getting good exp but couldnt go 100%afk but would be able to with potion buyer.</div></div><hr />

It is about 7k/h with larva and 17k/h in scarabs. but for your level id look for a much better script. maybe some cycs or something because you could be getting well above 40k/h at your lvl and thats without prem bonus</div></div><hr />

<br />
best bet for scripts like those would be to get yourself xenobot and use the scripts from there. as i have seen afew cyc scripts on there</div></div><hr />

Okay so something I was messing with this morning for premium Paladins, we're gonna head over to Ankrahmun. Head to the boat in thais, hi venore yes, at venore boat, hi ankrahmun yes, now ask for map guide and then click on over to the depot. Now we're here we want to have some good equipment, a plate set and medusa shield is working good for me and still leaves my account balance looking nice. So level 20's we're gonna go to the first floor central larvas with a nice royal spear refiller, no pot refiller because we don't need it here :D. Just start this script in the depot. When we hit level 30 we're gonna start going down one floor to the scarabs since the larvas will only give us 12/17k exp/h and the scarabs can give us up to 25k exp/h and thats just how we roll. :P<br />

If anyone wants a knight and mage version just hit me up! :P<br />
