I kept on getting kicked from the 15 minute AFK timer, even when using blackd or tibia auto. So I decided to take a look at some of blackds code from the Safe Cheats and see if I could make a runemaker that is SAFE.<br />
<br />
It includes some basic features<br />
<br />
Auto eat food with hotkey (CODED BY BLACKD, NOT ME)<br />
Runemaker (of couse it can make enchanted spears, pbolts, etc)<br />
Mana waster (once you run out of soul it will cast utana vid - currently not able to define the spell but this can easily be added)<br />
AFK mode or At Pc mode. With AFK mode the Tibia window MUST be the active window otherwise it won't work. If using At Pc mode the program will simply make a small beeping sound when the mana is at the right level, in order to grab your attention. You will need to eat your food manually on this mode.<br />
Anti-AFK function. The program will automatically move your character in a RANDOM direction to face up,down,right or left. I have used this program AFK and did not get kicked by the 15 minute timer.<br />
Program log. Simply logs all actions of the bot.<br />
The program also waits between 10 and 25 seconds before casting the spell, to make it look more human.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of the program:<br />

<br />
Setting up the runemaker section is very simple:<br />
Cast - This is what spell you will say<br />
Mana - How much mana it uses<br />
Soul - How much soul the spell costs<br />
Starting soul - How much soul you had before you started the program<br />
Mage/Paladin + Promoted - Simply used for mana regen calculations<br />
<br />
Please remember. ALL CREDITS TO BLACKD FOR AUTOEATER FUNCTION. The rest was done by me.<br />
It has been over 2 years since I made a program for Tibia and they have changed the way memory is read, so I have had to program it simply on a waiting function (it waits for your mana to grow via time instead of checking the memory). Please post any requests for adding functions or any bugs you find in this post and I will see what I can do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Version (2.1) - Friday 11th May 2012<br />
<br />
-Added soft boots option (as requested)<br />
-Added Life ring and Ring of healing option<br />
-Added customizable spell for once you run out of mana (it used to only allow utana vid)<br />
-Fixed some mana regen calculations that were incorrect.<br />
-The program has the ability to save all available variables for easy loading on the time you run it (All auto eater options, Spell word, spell mana, spell soul, vocation, promoted status, soft boots status, and also if the log is shown or not by default). If no config file is found the program will create one. The file is loaded automatically on startup and you can save all current settings through the new menu control.<br />
-A button has been added that will allow the quick selection of any in-game rune (see screenshot).<br />

Feedback and feature requests very welcome!<br />

As Adrego said, this program does not use packets, it works completely by in game pressing of hotkeys (this is why Tibia must be the active window). All actions are completely randomized (once you have the correct amount of mana it will wait a RANDOM amount of time before casting the spell, same with the anti-afk feature which moves your character in a random direction after a random amount of time). As far as CIP know, it looks exactly the same as a real person.</div></div><hr />

And I found nothing wrong in the code.<br />
<br />
Maybe it will not cast the spell if you are walking / playing Tibia instead being stopped, but that is not your fault.</div></div><hr />

How about adding a checkbox for Soft Boots?<br />

yes, it should be undetectable.</div></div><hr />

But if you want to use the code for something else I guess you should ask him first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jantje</div><div class="date">05-14-2012, 18:15</div></div><div class="posttext">At least not with the softboots checkbox marked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fr3quency_</div><div class="date">05-16-2012, 16:21</div></div><div class="posttext">New major version: 3.0<br />
<br />
Previously the program worked via a method of waiting for a certain amount of seconds for your mana to regen. This is why it was necessary to select mage/pally/promotion etc and then any other settings like life ring or softboots - so the program can calculate the correct amount of mana you regen per second. I have completley removed this function and now instead the entire application works from reading the mana (and soul) from the Tibia game. So now there is no need to tell the program if you are using soft boots for example.<br />
<br />
Personally I use Windows 7 64-bit and it is working perfectly for me, unfortunately I cannot test it on Windows XP right now. If you still experience problems, let me know and I will see if I can use an XP machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-16-2012, 16:36</div></div><div class="posttext">updated and uploaded.<br />
<br />
Note: you now depend on memory reading so you also depend on Tibia version now. The memory addresses will require an config update when Tibia gets updated.<br />
At this moment 3.0 will work in Tibia 9.53</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eclectic</div><div class="date">06-19-2012, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">Great, I really need this. <br />
Has anyone used it on windows exp yet? And does it work proberly on windows xp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">06-25-2012, 23:16</div></div><div class="posttext">updated for Tibia 9.54 and added it to my free downloads page https://blackdtools.com/freedownloads.php</div></div><hr />
