Well, they buy me a lot of gold and I never got problems with them. Try contacting them by email to solve that problem.</div></div><hr />

They work in those called 'sweatshops' to play MMOs all day and earn cash( usually without bots! ) for a living.They can choose a job like this or work in the mines. But I saw in your movie it's not only chinese goldfarmers. (With other MMOS like RS,maple etc it are usually chinese goldfarming companies everywhere.)<br />
They're not scammers. But still expensive compared to the Tibia market.<br />
<br />
Here's a movie of those guys: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho5Yxe6UVv4</div></div><hr />
