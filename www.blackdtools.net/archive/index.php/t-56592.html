1.  Character sees creature on screen.

On the Cavebot, no matter what options I use, this is how the character attacks:<br />
<br />
1.  Character sees creature on screen.<br />
2.  Character begins attacking creature even though not close enough to creature to attack.<br />
3.  Character goes to the square on the screen where it first saw the creature, even though it has already passed the creature it is supposed to be attacking.<br />
4.  Character arrives at square where creature was first seen, and bot realizes creature has moved.<br />
5.  Bot notes current location of creature and attempts to move the character to it, attempting to hit the creature it is attacking on the way.<br />
<br />
This roundabout way of attacking creatures is rather slow and in some cases causes the character to chase the creature a few times around obstacles before it finally catches up to hit it with a melee weapon.<br />
<br />
Is there any solution for this or is this a known bug / workaround to the Cipsoft 'anti-bot' system?</div></div><hr />

<br />
about anti-bot system: you must accept that using cavebot will probably mean a ban/delete in next ban wave, so only use that funciton in chars that you don't care to lose.</div></div><hr />
