Daniel this is kind of lame, but do you perhaps need 200k on Rookgaard? xD

I totally forgot about botting up again to buy myself a new license and here we are, I was mostly playing on open tibia servers during this past year and all my &quot;real&quot; Tibia accounts are facc and most of those are empty ... xD I got 111 knight with plate set and some shity club weapon, but in 3 days I think I'm not able to collect 200k ...<br />
<br />
Meh, I guess I'll have to consider my Tibia career ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, that was just a thought, all I got are those pretty useless 200k on Rookgaard that were stored on my rookie a year ago. Meh, too bad I can't take those 200k in main, would be great! :/<br />

Have fun guys! And keep your eye on your license expiration date!!!! Seriously, you never know ...</div></div><hr />
