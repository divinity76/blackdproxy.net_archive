I have been banned with all my main accounts(2x 90lvl knight 3x 50lvl sorc). I used blackd about 2 months ago for very short period of time(about week). After that time i didnt use that characters at all. I have beggan new bot project with new characters with another undetectable bot.(not blackd)<br />
After 2 months only characters which were boting with blackd has been banned. New characters survived.</div></div><hr />

@credz : that is very strange. Yes, they usually delete your account directly. But maybe they do exceptions on premium, who knows. Anyways please give more details on what cheats you used, what scripts, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
rofl, when i used black i didnt use any other bot at same time. <br />
After i changed bot to new (undetectable) i no longer used that characters. I created new accounts and started botting with new characters. <br />
Result?: All 5 characters which were using blackd have been banned. Characters which were using another bot (over 1.5 month) wernt banned<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion blackd is most detectable bot ;/ I get banned with almost all of my chars 2 times in the row.</div></div><hr />

<br />
+I just looked at your posts if you used all the stuff in your scripts that you posted about then it is no wonder you were detected. This is exactly why I only use waypoints and targetting with healer/conditional casting. I never do anything that will check cap or amounts of items. I believe those types of things get you detected.<br />
I'll keep botting and see if I get detected by the next ban wave.. 2x undetected would be quite good :).</div></div><hr />

you talk like someone that registered here only to do propaganda of other bots, really. That is bad. But saying that blackd proxy is the most detectable one is a plain lie. <br />
The rest of bot forums is full of reports of people who got detected &amp; deleted, just compare the numbers. Here I only see 1 or 2 reports and in my opinion they are a bit unbelievable.<br />
<br />
Btw, you can get deleted because you used a detectable thing in the past. Even if you format your computer and you don't use other bot after that.</div></div><hr />

Post a SS of your criminal record. Because I think, you have just said nigger on default and got a swearing ban on the same day as the massban, since all accounts are meant to be instant deleted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My main acc is deleted, used Blackd from lvl 2 to lvl 53 then i did it pacc at started playing with mine hands to lvl 71, all script i used are there in forum, some of malmis like swamp venore,rot venore and other from Sternam Undeads. <br />
<br />
But maybe casually or not, i dont get banned two acc free, lvl 50knight and 40 knight using same scripts -.-<br />
<br />
How i can understand that? doing mass ban they lose alot of cash.. <br />
<br />
I sended msg to support tibia and they said that:<br />
<br />
Thank you for your request.<br />
 <br />
After thoroughly checking your case again, we are still convinced that the entry<br />
in the rule violation record was justified. The Tibia Rules have been violated too<br />
often with the characters on this account. For this reason the account will be<br />
deleted and cannot be returned to you.<br />
 <br />
If you want to continue playing, you will have to create a new account.<br />
<br />
PD: I used some times conditionals for do exura ico, dani tu te crees que me banen una acc que apenas la bote afk estuve casi siempre delante y las otras que las dejo enchufadas mientras duermo i tienen una lista considerable en la death list que se nota mucho.. y no les pasa nada.. alomojor es porque me cree las acc mas tarde que esa?<br />
<br />
bye</div></div><hr />

If this is true, I highly reccomend you posting this information on tibia forums, through gameplay. I would love to see the reaction of 1000s of tibia players.</div></div><hr />

I have used my own scripts to bot all those chars, using conditionals to heal and refill mana, bank depositer, loot depositer on DP and in some cases buy/sell items to NPC. <br />
<br />
Neither this massban nor the previous one have deleted any of my accounts, that is the reason why I think BlackProxy its 100% safe when used properly.<br />
<br />
My brother also use this tool to bot his chars (6 accs), not even one deleted account either.<br />
<br />
Que si recomiendo este bot? Claro<br />
Que me han detectado mis cuentas alguna vez? Hasta el momento no<br />
Que seguiré usando BlackdTools? Porsupuesto que sí<br />

Take a little time and write your own scripts, Tyasdf~ is probably using month old if not year old scripts in my own opinion! Conditionals are 100% safe and I even use them on my main Premium accounts for back up heals while hunting stoned, dont knock BlackD Best bot around, its free and the best service I have ever seen!

I didnt used cave bot i only loged in with the bot open( forgot it was ... ), how you can explain i got banned for boting then ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">10-20-2012, 02:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Then your logging in with outdated Blackd Clients is the only thing I can think of plus you are using very old scripts that Malmis wrote, and probably a many other people using the exact same waypoints as you. Before you knock blackD you should learn to actually use it, no problems here. Been using Conditionals on my MAIN premiums or AFK Training on my premiums on Blackd for over a year solid.<br />
