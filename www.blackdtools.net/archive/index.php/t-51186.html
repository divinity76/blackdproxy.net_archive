We use a mage+summoned poison spider on the monk, to break its shield. 
 
Well, our problem is that when we train afk, sometimes our attacks get into the shieldbreaking spots, so we're not doing any damage to the monk. We also tried to break its shield with the mage and another character, but the problem still :S 
 
We have found that on Pskonejott.com: 
 
But, anyway with poison spider and wild warrior, it does the same." />

We use a mage+summoned poison spider on the monk, to break its shield.<br />
<br />
Well, our problem is that when we train afk, sometimes our attacks get into the shieldbreaking spots, so we're not doing any damage to the monk. We also tried to break its shield with the mage and another character, but the problem still :S<br />
<br />
We have found that on Pskonejott.com:<br />
<br />
There ig a glitch in Tibia that makes some monsters a bad choice for taking the monk shielding spots. For instance, if you use 2 rotworms every now and then the sequence will change and you'll move onto a shielding spot. You won't be able to bleed the monk so your training will effectively stop.<br />

But, anyway with poison spider and wild warrior, it does the same.<br />
<br />
Also note, that we are using a script to stop attacking the monk when its hp is low. Thats all, if somebody can give us an answer to what we're doing wrong to get onto the breakshielding spots, that would be awesome :)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!</div></div><hr />

Think you answered your own question... When they re-attack afterwards they may jump onto a shielding spot<br />
<br />
Don't think you can solve this unless you make your mage unattack at aswell?</div></div><hr />
