That being said, this is a much better money maker then the Thais Trolls, due to being able to collect Medicine pouches while hunting, and the chance to come across feverish citizens and loot a few add-on pieces. Make changes where required if you wish to deposit after more then 4 Medicine pouches or more then 1000 gold. Again, this is basic but works nonetheless, pre-equip your characters because there is no re-fillers only a depositer. This is for learning purposes and I hope more people start to contribute to our community.<br />
<br />
Required; Lvl ~10 Wound Cleansing/Light Healing, 10-20 Potions and decent equipment to deal with the Rotworms.<br />
<br />
Note: Start this script in Venores East depot, where the banker is located and Shovel &amp; Rope is required.<br />

<br />
How do i make pick up spears when i have under, lets say 8. And make it not put it in depot.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, hope its not too tricky;)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chillmode</div><div class="date">11-28-2012, 01:42</div></div><div class="posttext">or where can i find a list with all the commands? should be somewhere, so i can fix these things myself just as u say!<br />
<br />
thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">11-29-2012, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Well like I stated this is a simple script and I wont be making a spear refiller on this due to it sending packets, my suggestion would be to activate trainer, so when you kill swamp trolls and your spears reach less than X move CD 0C into left hand, and it should pick it up off trolls when looting I believe. I will try and make an example of how to explain Trainer.<br />
<br />
Note; No guarentee but I will try and take a picture on how to set-up trainer properly.<br />
<br />
Edit; These simple scripts I have released are mainly for Knights but can work on any vocation If you give them a weapon/shield.</div></div><hr />

That being said I released every script I ever made for levels 8-90+ you can find these scripts in my botting project near the end on pages 18/19 I believe but take a look through and you will see some of the profits I made using these wonderful scripts I made personally!<br />
<br />
To find my botting project goto the main forum page &gt; Screenshots &gt; Botting Project(top of the screenshots page)&gt; Money Making First Attempt by Lithium &gt; Pages 17/18 or 19 will have every script I ever made!<br />
<br />
To the person who was inquiring about a spear picker upper I apologize I never made the tutorial what I had typed out had pretty much summed it up, you just had to add into the trainer item id (CD 0C?) &lt;8 move into left hand but since it has been about 2 years my memory is a little foggy on the uses of BlackD!<br />
<br />
Hope everyone enjoys my project and ALL my free scripts, please just use them and if you feel the need to edit and re-post them please give me credit for all the hard work I put in!<br />

I tested it out the other day and it was not working, would just run me around venore for a bit then go out south a little bit and repeat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 It's because this script is from pre-revamped Venore, so it will try to go cross the bridge to go to the cave and fail, then come back, repeat... I'm not sure if the cave itself got revamped as well some years ago (I never really botted in Venore back then), but now it's pretty buggy for Blackd around that part of the cave with lots of stairs (although I think the problem is on the floor). <br />
 I suggest you to make one for yourself, since it's awesome profit there (med pouches), making a 20ish beat  a 40ish in most facc places.</div></div><hr />
