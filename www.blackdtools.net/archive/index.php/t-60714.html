<br />
I just started using blackd trainer some time ago on my pally to train with my friend, so i never acctualy had to pay attention to his HP, since he was also botting the whole time.<br />
<br />
Now im training with gargoyles, but its very easy to get their hp to red. So, i wanna know if there is any way to make the bot switch between 2 gargoyles. When one of them gets down to red hp, the bot will atk the other one automatically.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if it is possible without using any scripts? I dont trust scripts, i thinks they are the reason why people are getting banned.</div></div><hr />
