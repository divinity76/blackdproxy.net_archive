<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tony32</div><div class="date">07-22-2010, 13:54</div></div><div class="posttext">Poison Ivy is sure a classic. Works very well (dunno about later OS doh). You can do everything with it. Watch webcams, files, remote desktop, audio etc etc.<br />
<br />
There is also another one called SpyNet, I have the latest version somewhere on my old computer so maybe I can help you if you need it. SpyNet is like Poison Ivy but a little bit newer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kolehti</div><div class="date">07-23-2010, 08:58</div></div><div class="posttext">exactly. Then there is ProRat which is public. Of course almost every public RAT is detectable by AV's but you can use a packer to prevent that from happening.</div></div><hr />
