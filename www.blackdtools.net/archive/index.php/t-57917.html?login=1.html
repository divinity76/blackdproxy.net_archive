I´ve been brainstorming about how this auto detection tool wroks. Ofc its all speculations but still, hope this might help someone 
 
Concidering how they would want to descriminate against vocations I guess it would be something that all the vocations do while botting 
here is a list of things I think likely they (CIP with the tool) would attack 
 
 
-Healing/Potions 
they could have made some search bot that detects if you always auto heal after 80% or always mana up at 50%. So" />
