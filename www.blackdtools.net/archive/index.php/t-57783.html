I don't get disconnected while cavebotting, from the thing you said I presume it's the new CipSoft's anti-kick system which kicks you out if you connection is bad, and that system isn't 100%; it doesn't work, read support forums on tibia.com.</div></div><hr />

It's a CipSoft problem then. They released that new system and it doesn't work as they thought it would. There are threads open on support tibia.com boards, lots of people complained, I dunno what is next CipSoft's step, but something is for sure ... BlackD's working fine ... At least for me. :eek:</div></div><hr />
