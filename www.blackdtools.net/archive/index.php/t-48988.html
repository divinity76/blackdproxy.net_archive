I need some reply on this thread. Does anyone here who just uses the bot to TRAIN got banned?<br />
<br />
Does anyone here who mc'ed and train got banned?<br />
<br />
Who got banned, please, tell me how it happened...<br />
<br />
I'm almost sure only MCs get bans...If that's true, i think a Virtual Machine will solve our problems...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Linden12</div><div class="date">05-14-2010, 04:22</div></div><div class="posttext">ive been botting 24/7 with atleast 2 chars, i use Blackd + MC, with no ban<br />
but when i create new accounts they get banned, on that day.<br />
plus if i had a account that i bot, i tryed making a new char on it and when i botted that new char, it got bannished, maybe it has something to do with the age of character?<br />
<br />
edit - <br />
when i finished botting those 2 chars (no stamina) i bot another 2-3 diffrent chars, no ban</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was botting one character from 1 to 12 lvls. Yesterday when I came from school I  had turned on my cavebot. After 2 hours when I came to my computer the alarm was ringing. I've got banned at this account, but on second account where I have 26 lvl and I was boting all week.There I do not have a deletion.<br />
Banishment:	Account banished until deletion because of using unofficial software to play (Automatically detected)<br />
Sorry for my english. ;p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friday</div><div class="date">05-22-2010, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm how to explain..<br />
<br />
if you have a 1 year old char and you used your arrow keys to walk for like 200 days and mouseclicks for 165 days then you are a arrow key char which makes you safe because you are on the computer but if you use mouseclicks then you will be known as botter..<br />
<br />
but now they made the time between new checks for like 30 days each bannwave so if you use 20 days mouseclicks which bots do so you are a botter and 10 days arrow keys will replace the 20 days mouseclicks and you have 10 mouseclicks left which still marks you as botter..<br />
<br />
This can happen even if you dont use a bot which some people say &quot;I NEVER USED BOT BUT BANNED&quot; and nobody believes him but its true..<br />
<br />
If you start a new char, doesnt matter which account, and if you start bot directly from beginning so you gain only mouseclicks and 30 days are not much and you are banned.. <br />
<br />
Just a theory dont flame me!!</div></div><hr />
