We are using a downgraded 7.72 to give a good old classic feel of old 7.4 Tibia. You are required to use our custom client.

<br />
We are using a downgraded 7.72 to give a good old classic feel of old 7.4 Tibia. You are required to use our custom client. We want the experience to be essential and legit, thereby we are not focused on custom content - we are a very community focused server and if the users wish to have more custom content it might be added later on.<br />
<br />
We will have very lowrate server, promising NO RESETS.<br />
There will be NO &quot;pay to win&quot;, &quot;golden account&quot;, free light hack, better loot and more exp. Only standard premium account. (no shortcuts on djinn quests or postman either)<br />
<br />
Player Ruled Server (Community)<br />
Our goal is to intervene as little as possible, this server will be completely ruled by the players. Of course we will still ban cheaters and find them out, but that is about it. We really hope this will work out, that it will be a nice server without extreme power abusing.<br />
<br />
Features (that was not in original 7.4)<br />
- Port Hope<br />
- POI spawn and quest<br />
- Tasks<br />
- Epic quests<br />
- Wands and rods are only obtainable by quests but they have lost their abilities<br />
- Bank (all houses uses the balance for the rent)<br />
<br />
Rates<br />
2x on experience and regeneration, the rest is normal 7.4 like.<br />
<br />
Tasks<br />
There are two NPCs giving out tasks, with a total of 71 different tasks (currently). You can always have one task for each NPC active. The reward will range from experience to different items depending on the completed task. Some tasks like &quot;apes&quot;, or &quot;orcs&quot; only requires you to kill from that race and not the exact specific creature.<br />
<br />
Bugs<br />
Our management has spent a lot of time tuning, fixing and enhancing our server to ensure that there's no game stopping errors or bugs. Our team will spend a lot of time looking in to logs, the forum and other resources where our players will be able to report any potential error/bug that they may encounter while on our server.<br />
<br />
Epic Quests<br />
For the more role playing adventure type we added hard to solve &quot;epic&quot; quests that can only be solved once, the rewards are legendary of course! With exception of the ones in rook they can be done multiple times.<br />
<br />
Custom Client<br />
We chose to stick to the original 7.4 client as much as possible.<br />
