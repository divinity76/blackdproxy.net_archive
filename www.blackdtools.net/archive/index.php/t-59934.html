maybe one of the floor changers is not recognized as floor changer. in that case the cavebot won't attempt to use in that way.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
- inspect the tile id of the floor changer not being used<br />
- close blackd proxy<br />
- add tile id to the list of floor changers in config-latestversion\config.ini <br />
- reload blackd proxy and test cavebot now<br />
<br />
-OR- just send me (by email) a screenshot of the stairs giving you problem plus the x,y,z position of such stairs.<br />
you can get current x,y,z using the command<br />
exiva pos<br />
then I will visit the place and I will fix the problem for the next version of Blackd Proxy.</div></div><hr />
