Probably also some tomb-2 with hmms/gfb - BUT DONT COUNT FOR PROFIT!!<br />
Drags with ds is not worst idea also.<br />
<br />
The way to go is to kill rotworms and make runes I believe. Then go hunt with them or sell uhs and buy hmms/some gfbs. Its like a must until 40 lvl I guess...</div></div><hr />
