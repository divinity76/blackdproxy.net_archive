I just need a simple fishing script with waypoints included, I mean I don't need a whole script, just an idea how I could make it because I've tried 'exiva fish' and 'fishX' but I can't get it to work combined with waypoints ... 
 
For an example:  
 
1.) 'exiva fish' works perfectly but I can't figure out how to put it in between waypoints so it fishes till all fishes are gone/fished and then move to the next waypoint. 
 
2.) fishX 24 ... For me it doesn't work, it won't fish" />

I just need a simple fishing script with waypoints included, I mean I don't need a whole script, just an idea how I could make it because I've tried 'exiva fish' and 'fishX' but I can't get it to work combined with waypoints ...<br />

<br />
2.) fishX 24 ... For me it doesn't work, it won't fish for 24 times ...<br />
<br />
Any ideas, I know it seems quite easy, but I can't figure it out :(<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably best to use exiva fish and put it 24 times in the script... Long.... but will work.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is a massive free acc area fishing script somewhere on BlackD forums. Try having a look for that it might shed some light on it. Maybe they used a condition. I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Goodluck</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I'll try that out when I get home ... Made a long script like you said with 'exiva fish' but the thing is that if I fish for 24 times that doesn't mean I'll fish every fish on the screen, after that there are still some left.<br />

Yeah, I've used search function numerous times now and nothing seems like what I'm looking for, especially when there's a link to a thread but there's nothing because thread was deleted ... Meh ...</div></div><hr />
