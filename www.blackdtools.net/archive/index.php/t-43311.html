You act like we all know, retarded thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waffe</div><div class="date">08-03-2009, 07:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Not realy retarded.. as i havent seen any kind of suggestions of re programming the bot or anything that &quot;serius&quot; as its just &quot;It can be that it can be this, blabla..&quot; Dosent anybody know anything? and i made this thread for updating myself of the problem as ive been away for the summer and dont know whats up with the anti bot, if there is any new suggestion to solve the problam, so the thread is for updating me and maybe also get some more detailed info from Daniel..<br />
As the &quot;5 theories&quot; all fails cuz of ppl are following the &quot;Solution: avoid changing tibia title.&quot; &quot;Solution: At this moment try to use scripts with conditional paths&quot; &quot;Solution: Update Blackd Proxy&quot;... But people are still being banned so its not working at all..<br />
<br />
If you dont like my idea, rly.. like keep it to yourself.. :/ As i said i just want to update myself.<br />
<br />
For calcs..<br />
80% of the Tibia community is using some kind of bot.. or atleast around those numbers, if Cipsoft ban those 80% and 60% of them stop playing Cipsoft are going to lose about 45% of their income..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waffe</div><div class="date">08-03-2009, 08:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Example taken from NG Forums.<br />
<br />
This is probably and most likely, a scare attempt. I been botting 3 characters over level 100 in the same server. Only 1 of them got banned. That character was visited by a GM various times. They must have added me to their bot-list. My other 2 characters haven't got visited by a GM. Every time the GM went to my main, I logged off my other chars.<br />
<br />
Have you been visited by a GM recently?<br />
Have you mass leveled?<br />
Were you online a lot?<br />
Have you crashed and sent an error report after opening Tibia again?<br />
<br />
I would like to know if you were over or below level 100. That is to know if CipSoft just banned about 4500 low level characters and 500 high levels. You don't have to answer all that. Just think about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Satanás</div><div class="date">08-03-2009, 09:12</div></div><div class="posttext">I got your point, well, I'm summarize my experience:<br />
<br />
So, I got banned on a 200+ on the second wave. (And I have not seen any GM on at least 6 months, but it were a very well-known bot char.)<br />
<br />
And with it, I got banned on all my other active chars, and none of them were never ever met by a GM, and those were low levels. (Also on the second wave.)<br />
<br />
I was using only blackd all the time.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
Now I'm not botting and I have not been banned too, so this &quot;GM bot list&quot; is fake imo.<br />
<br />
And they do ban hlvl and lowlvl on just a wave.<br />
<br />

<br />
THEY DETECT ALL BOTS, NO MATTER U BOT 1 MIN OR 100 DAYS THEY DETECT IT<br />
<br />
the bans are 100% random so dont try to find &quot;how they are detecting it&quot;<br />
<br />
options: -use the bot just with moneymakers, get rich<br />
-bot ur char like a robot for amonth, get high lvl, then get banned, and after a month enjoy it.<br />
-stop paying for bots, and make other follow ur example, and than maybe with lost customers, bot developers will maybe make an undetectable bot, I have a friend that has undetectable bot for wow, so cip is like 1/100 of wow LOL, i mean nothing....but in what i've seen in the bots update not changes in the programs..just in the functions which ofc is useless and make the bots more lame for me and ppl that have a brain and use them with moneymakers or chars that doesnt matter and no mains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on the first day of february 2010 your deletion warning will be gone with your criminal record, unless you commit another rule violation, even a simple namelock or notation.<br />
<br />
OT:<br />
indeed they are detecting cheaters somehow and it's just not about bots. people that test the YATC had characters banned(http://yetanother.tibiaclient.com/use-on-cipsoft-tibia-servers)<br />
-&quot;During 2009, automatic bans have occured for use of YATC.&quot;<br />
that takes me to the logical conclusion that cip must be embedding some data on the padding bytes of encrypted packets, using a modified xtea algorithm or sending info using some other way.<br />
<br />
randomizing things in the bot is a bad bad idea, won't solve anything if they analyze network traffic as described in this paper - http://www.hindawi.com/journals/asp/2009/797159.html. it just makes the bot slow, unreliable and still detectable.<br />
<br />
if it's true that ng and elfbot are getting less detection, which i don't know, blackd should walk on the same direction of them, use dll injection, that is, but it will require the huge effort of rewriting the bot almost from scratch and move away from vb6.</div></div><hr />

80% of the Tibia community is using some kind of bot.. or atleast around those numbers, if Cipsoft ban those 80% and 60% of them stop playing Cipsoft are going to lose about 45% of their income..<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't that the reason of Blizzard's WoW Warden? Every player that plays official WoW have to pay (yes yes there is a trial and wow &quot;ot&quot;), so isnt it the same case?<br />
If they deleted everyone there will be setbacks in their income.<br />
Blizzard sued &quot;wow glider&quot;, a popular bot company and made it pay a big fine of US$<br />
<br />
Anyways the WoW cheating problem is FAR less massive than Tibia, the &quot;Soulbound&quot; and &quot;Binds on pickup&quot; makes you impossible to trade/sell/buy high level items from others even if you have a TON of money.<br />
and everyone who plays wow knows that you can't solo hunt in instances/raids without a team..<br />
<br />
well sorry for out of topic.<br />
<br />
Cipsoft has finally started to crack down bots, and currently I don't see NG and Elf doing anything against it, I just see them saying: &quot;use under your own risks.&quot;<br />
on the other hand Daniel is making huge efforts to find out what exactly detects a botter with a non botter. We all know now that randomizing won't help, and people had been banned only by logging in with blackd..<br />
<br />
at the moment, rewritting everything will be painful, but it would be even more painful if the &quot;rewritted&quot; bot also gets detected. <br />
The best action now is to figure out how the cip detector works, which is quite difficult because a ban wave occurs only every couple of months and not all detected accounts get banned... which makes testing even harder..<br />
 <br />
regarding again about the first post,<br />
<br />
Yes, there are even ways to make known viruses/trojans again undetected by antiviruses, by trying to know what exactly gets detected and changing it. After you can test it RIGHT AWAY and multiple times with your home's AintiVirus.<br />
But you can't do it with the same speed in Tibia, it might take years..<br />
and besides a bot has much more content than a virus..<br />
