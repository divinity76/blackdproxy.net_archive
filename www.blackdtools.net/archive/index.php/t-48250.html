you should change to a 64 bits system...it's a memory addressing issue that all windows 32 bits have</div></div><hr />

Thats right after start up, so idk but aim and msn automatically load up which might lead to that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No way msn and aim would kill so many resources xD<br />
<br />
Farsa's got a point tho, you will do much better with a 64 bit OS</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get some more info on your heating situation use this link to download speccy.<br />
Play some wow.<br />
Load up Speccy after that and then post a ss.<br />
