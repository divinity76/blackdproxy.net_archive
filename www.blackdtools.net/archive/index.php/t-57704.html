<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">04-08-2012, 10:56</div></div><div class="posttext">That's weird ... Haven't happened to me after these couple of updates, only time I was kicked out was while I was training (new anti idle system) and when my net fucked up.<br />
<br />
Cavebotting seems flawlessly for me. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">04-08-2012, 17:32</div></div><div class="posttext">That is probably because your connection and the new tibia antickick system. Now they do an intended kick if they detect a slow connection in your side.<br />
Anyways, if Blackd Proxy show any error or debug then please send me the errors.txt file and I will fix it.<br />
(But I am afraid that this case is not a problem of Blackd Proxy)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nizlov</div><div class="date">04-08-2012, 19:36</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am getting many kicks too (connection lost), but the weird thing is that it happens only on instances of Tibia which are running under BlackD Proxy. I am running 10 mcs on 2 virtual machines and 5 mcs on my main system. There are single kicks on the virtual machines, same as on main system. But I do not get kicked on the instance of Tibia which is not connected by BlackD Proxy.<br />
<br />
And if I am playing without any tools I don't get kicks at all, tested for 14 hours without BlackD Proxy and there was no kick. With Proxy there are kicks every 2-3 hours.<br />
<br />
There is no difference if I am running 15 mcs or just 3, kicks are still occuring.<br />
<br />
Can I do anything about it?</div></div><hr />

i got no error msgs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">05-06-2012, 22:41</div></div><div class="posttext">just ensure you limit your tibia fps to 20 or 25 so your computer don't use 100% cpu on tibia itself. If blackd proxy have no cpu left then it won't send packets at time and that might be considered as connection lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm having the same issue using Blackd 25.0 and Tibia 9.61. Exact same symptoms: this only happens while cavebotting using Blackd; there is not a single kick / freeze when I close Blackd and open Tibia, and my 20 Mbps internet connection itself works fine. I'm using Windows XP, if that matters.<br />
<br />
I've only noticed the problem when using more than one Tibia client. When only opening one client it seems to work fine. <br />
<br />
Tibia fps is set to 25 and my CPU usage with two MCs open is only 15%. Nothing special is logged in errors.txt. Any ideas? Anything else I can do? Daniel, if you give me instructions I'd love to help you debug this.<br />
<br />
kexxet, nizlov: Did you manage to resolve the issue? If so, how? If not, can you post more details about your system configuration so we can pin this issue down?</div></div><hr />
