<br />
long time botter here, not very familiar with Blackd though.<br />
<br />
So I'd like to bot on Tibianic which is a very well known OT. It uses a custom client, version 7.4 with parts from 7.72 afaik.<br />
<br />
I followed the steps which were described to get the bot to work..let me copy&amp;paste it from Malmis<br />
<br />
- Download and install their custom client<br />
- Put a copy of the &quot;tibia.dat&quot; file from the custom Tibia client installation directory in your &quot;Blackd Proxy/config772&quot; (rename the old &quot;tibia.dat&quot; or delete it)<br />
- Start Blackd Proxy and open the &quot;Advanced&quot; window<br />
- Select &quot;Tibia 7.72&quot; in the &quot;Load a config for different Tibia:&quot; drop-down and press &quot;Do it (will close ALL)&quot;<br />
- Start Blackd Proxy and open the proxy window<br />
- Set the forwarding option to &quot;Forward to OT server&quot;<br />
- Enter &quot;tibianic-hr.org&quot; in server IP and &quot;7272&quot; in &quot;login port:&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I've had the problem that there was no Tibia.dat existing in the config772 folder, hence I had nothing to overwrite or delete..Actually I couldn't find any Tibia.dat in the whole blackd folder.<br />
<br />
I can start the bot and Tibia, BUT the bot doesn't inject/load/recognize the Tibia client.<br />
<br />
Is there something im doing wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope you understood my problem and have a solution for this, I'd be really thankful :)<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />
