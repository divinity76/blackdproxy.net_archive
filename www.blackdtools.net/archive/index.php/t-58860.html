<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">08-30-2012, 09:21</div></div><div class="posttext">Please for the love of god stop training on an Enraged White Deer for starters. But it seems like Hellsx has explained your problem, your cavebot is timing out after the amount of time it has spent on one mob. Can always add a command <br />
SetBot EnableMaxAttackTime=1<br />
SetMaxAttackTimeMs 90000  ( That is 90 seconds ) <br />
<br />
Now, second scrap the command that says stop attacking target when under 50% I used it before it never worked, stop trying.<br />
Training with a secondary account will be much better, get a second level 10 knight out of rook and have them train together, or better yet, get a mage level 25 with summon creature, attack eachother mage summons two rats and then you have a perfect train, just need to bring food. Hope this helped,<br />
