If you want to buy a big amount of gold fast, without paypal verification, then please consider using xoom.com . That method is 100% safe for us so it is allowed for everybody.<br />
Just contact me by email and I will tell you where to send the money when paying by xoom.com<br />
My email: daniel@blackdtools.com<br />
<br />
And please keep in mind that paying by card in Xoom.com have a fixed cost of 9.99USD<br />
<br />
Sorry for the inconvenience.</div></div><hr />
