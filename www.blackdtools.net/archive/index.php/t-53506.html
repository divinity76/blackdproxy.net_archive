<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jonesman</div><div class="date">12-04-2010, 14:11</div></div><div class="posttext">i see many ppl dont like the update and are still crying like b4 the pvp changes and they still play .. lol<br />
so somehow it still keeps them playing either if they like it or not<br />
<br />
me for myselfe like the update but the cooldowns are a bit too long i think<br />
for sure mages can make way more exp then ek<br />
if you look at tibiacast you see that ppl like satanas doing 2-3kk/h exp and knights are even fighting to get 500k/h if they want it solo and dont waste too much and mages still profit<br />
thats just so unbalanced so its just fair, now you will need teams to hunt deeper banuta and shit so it improoves the team spirit as this is a multi player game you should not lvl all way solo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lexxis123</div><div class="date">12-04-2010, 14:35</div></div><div class="posttext">/\ What did they changed bout the mages then<br />
<br />
Since i saw a 57 druid hitted 580 with a new wavespell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">12-04-2010, 16:31</div></div><div class="posttext">To be fair the highest levels are knights... Knights do and can PG 1kk/h with profit... After the update there is no more UE spam leveling (for mages) but will be new UE style leveling for knights. So they swapped magic abilities from mages to knights xD</div></div><hr />

There are not many client changes except the icons, which are nothing special in my point of view. They are small but they do really help you about exhaustion times:<br />

<br />
This is the new menu, if you click on your character:<br />

Only got a few mounts and they all seem very cool. Check this example of the summer outfit over a Wailing Widow with different perspectives. Notice how different the outfits become, much more cooler! :<br />

Do they affect, pvp and/or speed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-04-2010, 20:00</div></div><div class="posttext">Cooldow is the new name for exhausted. You know, when you cast a spell you have to wait a few seconds before cast another? It is the same thing but with a different name.<br />
You might wonder, why they were implemented? Well, after the new update, spells like beams, ultimates, and some exori's will have  4s, 8s, 50s or even 60 seconds delay. So they had to create a new system to show user when is he going to be able to cast them again.<br />
Basically, if you see the icons picture above, those icons are only to show you the exhaustion time. They cannot be clicked like elfbot nor even change their position on screen.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-04-2010, 20:02</div></div><div class="posttext">Samzo, I do not notice much difference on speed but yes, it is increased a bit.<br />
They bring a hole new style to Tibia. Hehe<br />
<br />
<br />
Also there are new channel names. Take a look at them:<br />

<br />
Spellbook now host house spells:<br />

While playing around now, i found out that they changed the antidote rune. Take a look at the new one:<br />

And these are the items with their respective attributes of the items used to catch rides:<br />

<br />
As far as Ive seen, they crippled paladins a little taking away utamo vita and not adding nicer offensive spells....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-05-2010, 19:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats true. I was hunting with a 200+ EK and believe me, he could kill as fast as me some of the new lizards. And I'm mage. <br />
Here's my opinion about the new balancing:<br />
<br />
Knights:<br />
Knights will be good. After the update, the sequence &quot;exura-mana potion-exori&quot; will end, making the game play with knights more interesting, harder and funnier. The new spells inflict hight damage and with a bit of waste you can now get over 500k/h without much trouble.<br />
<br />
Paladins:<br />
They are almost the same thing. Utamo vita, exura vita were worthless spells for the vocation. Only Invisible could do something, but thats not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Druids:<br />
They made good changes and for now they have more possibilities vs creatures. Big delays fucked up everything.<br />
New spells are interesting and useful. <br />
<br />
Sorcerers:<br />
Sorcerers, they screw up the vocation. Known as their big power with waves and UE, playing on a mage isn't as funny as it used to be. What is a sorcerer without his waves or his UE?<br />
<br />
<br />
About the new spells, Cip could not even draw new sprites. So the new magics have the same draws and appearance as the old ones...</div></div><hr />
