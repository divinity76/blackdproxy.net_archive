NO, every bot gets detected in the same way<br />
in my opinion blackd is not the best bot out there.<br />

all ur questions are answered in other threads, so please use the search function next time.</div></div><hr />

I made a new bot from scratch. It is called Blackd Safe Cheats.<br />
You can read more in the new subforum.</div></div><hr />

Sorry mate, but Blackd is the best bot out here it's just detectable which is tragic but as blackd says /\ try the new Safebot</div></div><hr />

How is BlackD the best bot out there? ElfBot, TuG, and NG are WAY MORE advanced and WAY MORE undetectable then BlackD. Whats special about BlackD? It uses a proxy? Which is way more detectable and offers less benefits then a hook proxy? Lets compare.<br />
<br />
- BlackD -<br />
This bot doesn't have many features. It uses a Proxy, so it's just sending raw packets to the server/client, which is very detectable. The GUI is horrible, it was coded in VB6, which is like a 10 year old IDE from like Windows 98. The cave bot ain't that advanced, there is no randomness involved, which means more easy to detect, not to mention EVERYTHING is confusing.<br />
<br />
- TUGBot -<br />
More features? Yes.<br />
More advanced? Yes.<br />
Less detectable? Not one person has been banned yet.<br />
Payment? Free.<br />
<br />
- ElfBot -<br />
More features? Yes.<br />
More advanced? Most advanced there is.<br />
Less detectable? Definitely.<br />
Payment? 1 time payment and you get it for LIFE.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you still think BlackD is the &quot;best bot&quot; out there? I'm sure it's better then you're &quot;Undetected Tool&quot;, which is gonna fail, because it's in VB6 too and you have no knowledge on what's detectable and what isn't, you're just making stuff up and misleading people.<br />
Daniel knows his bot is going down. Remember when Tibia put in Addler and he was running around offering to pay for someone to help me get past it? He knows his bot ain't the best, he also knows he's probably not gonna be able to stop the bans. Which is why hes making BlackD Safe Cheats instead of investigating Tibia's detection methods. Not dissing him or anything, but be honest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If detection is server-sided there is nothing to investigate. We may only guess what's detectable or not. If it was client-sided it would be noticed already probably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BlackD couldn't make a bot as good as ElfBot or NG, so I don't see how he's more intelligent. He is PAYING people to fix his problems for him. This is fine, I don't care, but saying his bot is better then Elf/NG/TUG is wrong.</div></div><hr />
