<br />
exactly, i assume it wouldn't be too hard to do it through the mouse and keyboard; even if you had to keep the tibia client open on your screen. 1 bot at any one time is better than none ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raonikct</div><div class="date">02-17-2010, 23:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats what i think, is better if you do bot with the client focused, than nothing. And.. i could bot on my laptop :p</div></div><hr />

It's not necesary get focused tibia windows. I think is more dificult make a looter than nothing...</div></div><hr />

Well reading the containers you could actually find out what items are what and where they are.. and add the mouse events</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raonikct</div><div class="date">02-18-2010, 03:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, how could you move your character without bot and with the client minimized ? Thats the point by using keyboard and mouse on cavebot, to appear like a human, thats why the client focused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darego</div><div class="date">02-18-2010, 04:00</div></div><div class="posttext">even if he could make one for now without a looter. it doesn't have to be 100% afk does it? just something to work with and level with while he figures something out</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mouse events might change depending of resolution... so it's not easy do a general solution. Anyways it's not imposible and just required a little time more.<br />

<br />
Well, how could you move your character without bot and with the client minimized ?<br />
<br />
We can simulate a virtual keyboard and mouse with window's APIs. That will appear like a human.<br />

see yaa!</div></div><hr />

They have some new functions created,but they have to wait for some ban waves to check if is 100% safe =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darego</div><div class="date">02-19-2010, 23:02</div></div><div class="posttext">i didn't ask for a time and a date ;0 i asked him to let us know if he is working on any cavebot (macro maybe?) function or if it's impossible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-22-2010, 16:57</div></div><div class="posttext">the main problem will be the looting, but it is not impossible. Just very hard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raonikct</div><div class="date">02-22-2010, 19:19</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, what about releasing a bot without loot ? Better than nothing :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
yuuup i'm sure a lot of people would be grateful and use it on their main chars at least<br />
<br />
if you did a vote or something i bet 95% of people would rather that for now than nothing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manitake</div><div class="date">03-17-2010, 17:06</div></div><div class="posttext">nah I'd rather he just take his time step by step and make sure things are safe. Thats the whole point of this bot, to be safe not to have the most features as quick as possible.</div></div><hr />
