Level: 42<br />

Magic Level: 11<br />

Since I don't have much cap I was wondering if it was possible for this amount of exp/hour without having to buy pots or anything, I can only carry about 50 mana potions with the Royal Spears. Also a depositer and spear or bolt refiller would be nice! like I said, money is not a problem<br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />
