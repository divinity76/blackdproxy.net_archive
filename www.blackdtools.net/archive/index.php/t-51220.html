<br />
Which bot have you thought of? My favourite is ElfBot NG which costs 20 euro. One other thing you should think of is that CipSoft has created an detection tool for botting.<br />
<br />
But if you are good at programing you should be able to block signals to the tibia client. Ask around and people will help you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shanera</div><div class="date">07-02-2010, 00:12</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you for your reply!<br />
<br />
I've not being thinking of a single bot, but 2 or 3. I have disposal of 1 computaer in my house, one broken prolly soon fixed, and 2 on my office, I intend to put them all to work for tibia soon.<br />
I was planning first to use blackd in all for mass moneymaking, and selfmade/paid virtual clicking bot in one single computer with pacc for safety. But it seems that manipulating blackd to completely timed programmed running for moneymaking is very hard with an auxiliary program... and that its easily possible with only elfbot, very easy after some study in its scripting lenguage, even with the banishments.<br />
<br />
So the variables I am taking in cosideration for CHOOSING bots are:<br />
<br />
Mass mcing    -   how many mcs can it run, blackd has the 0 framerate feature which allowed me to play 8 mcs with scripts to pkfleeing/deposit/refil<br />
NGsoft says NG turns the tibia to 0 framerate when minimized, but I've not tested it. Don't know about ELF/other bots. My initial intencion is running 15 mcs for computer, but I hope more.<br />
<br />
reconecting+script runnning, after kick/death/ss    -  NG is disconsidered, Blackd seems to be imposible to do anything like, but I can use a windows macroing lenguage to windows keyboard/mouse controlling, action timming, but very hard communication Blackd-&gt;Macro that can reloging and re-run script, ELFbot seems(I'm not sure) to be able to reconnect(risky) and running scripts easily and keep previous conection informations<br />
<br />
Variables and commands for complex scripting      -     NG disconsidered, Blackd has a lot of variables and simple commands that make scripting easy and make moneymaking almost as efficient as ELFbot, Elfbot has tons of variables and commands, that, even unsafe, makes me able to create great artificial inteligence scripts that requires big effort and study.<br />
<br />
Price      -   NG is rl money or cracked(risky hacked+ban, but maybe compensable for one computer), ELFbot is expensive rl money not easily crackeable and has the key renoving effort, while Blackd is cheap Tibia money, that is much easier.<br />
<br />
Safety    -   NG is said as heavly risky, but I do not know much, maybe all are same risk. ELFbot was said to me as risky, but as the most common and famous some people says that is possible not being banished with luck and effort on ban studying, Blackd kept me unbanished trought 3 banwaves some time before when I was comming back before in 4 mced facc chars with stones/rook/chicken feather/spear distance training with refiller/my fishing script/pacc edron rots, but some time later, I used rook script on 2 accounts<br />
on 6 chars, and retired those accounts, both were banished in next wave.<br />
It's said about Neobot to be completaly safe, but I do not know, In my noob opinion says that virtual clicking bots are safe as far as they are hidden and tibia is maximized, neobot can minimize tibia=risky. PLEASE GIVE ME SOME BANISHMENT INFORMATION!!! I do not know anything.<br />
I consider that if all bots are unknow risk, the best is elfbot for its completely afking with facc moneymaking on my office computers, and Blackd on my home computer because of it's price.<br />
<br />
Computer usage:   I've only runned blackd on my win-vista/500mb ram/pentium 2.8/mainboard's graphic adapter, and it works very good, I can run some mcs normally, and lots 0 framerated, but I am afraid might not work on my low computer that will be fixed. NG and ELFbot I don't know.<br />
<br />
:S<br />
<br />
Therefore I am completaly open to ideas about how should I use 24/7 internet computers to moneymake/safeafkpowergamming.<br />
AND some tips about my secondary plans: like program/site to gather tibia related websites data and complile into my more complete one. Also like several programs auxiliary to tibia, like map recorder(ive been to tpforums yesterday and they have a program exactaly how i need, just need to add some funcions), fully personalizable voice recognizer to speeching commanding, IE hotmail emails + tibia acc + charater automatic creation helper, and far in the future, my own bot with an interesting feature I thought some days ago.<br />
<br />
I've been trough elfbot manual for a fastlook, and it has tons of commands and variables that allow me complete afk leveling/moneymking with even many mcs, just need great artifical inteligence scripts, which is what I think is the funniest.<br />
<br />
Thank you again! I hope you can point me the best way to achieve my goals...<br />
<br />
please give me more informations about my variables! and add some variables too, if you please!</div></div><hr />
