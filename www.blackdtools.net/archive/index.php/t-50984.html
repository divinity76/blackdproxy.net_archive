Had the same problem, the battlelist adresses must be wrong because you only find some of the stuffs who is in the battlelist i had the sameproblem i had to make 2 separate adresses for both start and end to find my char and monsters..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zmulan</div><div class="date">06-18-2010, 02:51</div></div><div class="posttext">Had the same problem, the battlelist adresses must be wrong because you only find some of the stuffs who is in the battlelist i had the sameproblem i had to make 2 separate adresses for both start and end to find my char and monsters..<br />
<br />
what do you mean with 2 seperate addresses?<br />
atm i got<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BattleList_Begin = 0x0049A07C;<br />
BattleList_End = BattleList_Begin + BattleList_StepCreatures * BattleList_Max;<br />
<br />
anyway, do you know how to find each of those? so i can look them all up to make sure they have the correct values.<br />
<br />
now im using:<br />
BattleList_StepCreatures = 0xA8; //168<br />
BattleList_Dist = 156;<br />
BattleList_Max = 250;</div></div><hr />

No not this battlelist * steps etc.. wont work in my application i get overflow so i need a adress example from last<br />
<br />
BattleListBegin = &amp;H635F70 <br />
 BattleListEnd = &amp;H63FF9C <br />
<br />
You could just calculate it yourself if you have Battlelist start adress.<br />
<br />
0x63D350 + (0xA8 * 250)<br />
<br />
0xA8 * 250 is 0xA410 (42000)<br />
<br />
So, just add that to battlelist start:<br />
<br />
0x63D350 + 0xA410 = 0x647760<br />
<br />
There you go.<br />

thanks a lot,<br />
anyways, last question:<br />
could you point me in the right direction how i could find maxCreatures and stepCreatures?</div></div><hr />

i managed to find out that StepCreature = 156,<br />
<br />
i did some manual searching with TSearch ;&gt;<br />
<br />
since im not that skilled with Ollydbg<br />
anyways, how to find out maxcreatures on battlelist?</div></div><hr />

thx but this is for an older version,<br />
i already solved it anyway!<br />
cavebot _/<br />
<br />
currently the features sux tho,<br />
it can only follow waypoints on one floor, and attack creatures. But as it seems now he is just hitting random creatures, like 1 hit each rotworm lol.<br />
trying to solve that then im gonna have to fix looting ;&gt;<br />
<br />
thanks everyone for the help ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyway, its working now, thanks everyone for the help :P<br />
<br />
i've got another question tho, instead of just opening new threads ill ask here.<br />
<br />
atm im using a while loop to keep attacking the creature until it dies, but this freezez the whole program.<br />
anyone got a nice way to avoid that?<br />
<br />
edit: didnt saw there was a second page on the thread -.- hrhr</div></div><hr />

<br />
my bot checks the target for its HP% and isVisible properties (depending on if it's cavebot or trainer). if you want it to loot a monster, then make a loop that reads the isVisible and start looting when it returns 0<br />
<br />
also, you should look into multi-threading, it will solve your issues with freezing :p</div></div><hr />

You should use timers instead of loops while attacking, multithreading is however the best way of doing it</div></div><hr />

i did read a lot about multithreading, if i get to work on this again thats probably how it will be done</div></div><hr />
