<br />
I've made a cavebot script yesterday on Rookgaard. Very, very basic stuff: waypoints, setMeleeKill, setLootOff. Botted for 2 hours, then logged off. No one was there, so no one could report me. I didn't go AFK, was at the computer all the time.<br />
<br />
Today I've received the deletion. I don't know if there were any errors like @679alex is saying, I didn't check Proxy logs, just because nothing went wrong, script was running flawlessly.<br />
<br />
:( I'll post screenies of my account page, if some might be in doubts that this is fake.<br />
<br />
Edit: And right after I've posted this, CipSoft made an announcement:<br />
<br />
5562 Tibia accounts have been detected using unofficial software to play during the last couple of weeks. These accounts have been deleted today.</div></div><hr />
