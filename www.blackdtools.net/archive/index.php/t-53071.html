Why not make a group in that everyone enters who got scamed by gallar and we will then publish it and the total amount he has theft to all his friends and family?<br />

I personaly lost 240€ and I think it is only fair when he gets questioned by his parents, friends and girlfriend, why he is actualy such a badasshole.<br />

I think it will have enough influence if we just show his real friends how many people he has scamed and we will ask for the reason why.<br />
<br />
First of all we should collect all data we have about the losses:<br />
IF you have lost cash by being scamed of Gallar, POST the amount, time and what the object of trade was in HERE.<br />
<br />
That will help for now to have an overview.<br />
I start - May 2010 - lost 240€ in trading with him. He pretended to sell me 8kk on Eternia. We traded viva western Union.<br />

btw spending 240 euros on a game character i think is more then above OK :p well if u haven't done trades with this guy before.<br />

Also how did you pay him? you didn't contact the bank,site, etc as soon he scammed you? you could have stopped it.</div></div><hr />

If you would mind reading my post you would find out most of your questions.<br />
In addition, I cant call his parents because his parents kinda dont speak english soo good. I already called them once :)<br />

About the facebook idea... it is just to show the world what an asshole that guy is.<br />
The imagine damage he will suffer will be high</div></div><hr />

Then what?.. when you have noticed the world.. then what ?<br />
btw.. you didn't even answer 2 of my other questions<br />
<br />
p.s: Why just gallar, just make a group on facebook and call it: all who have been scammed on tibia characters.. and invite ALL who have been scammed.. it's not only you who have been scammed by some guy.. there are other peoples who have been too<br />
p.s2: This thread isn't going to be here very long.. this isn't a scam hunter forum.. contact those who have been scammed and handle it internal..</div></div><hr />

If you guys want to do that, do that somewhere else.<br />
I won't allow you to come up with something evil about anyone in this forum.<br />
<br />
@Olzone and @PlznoKill<br />
If it sounds stupid to you, don't post.<br />
The thread is serious and TimTrade got a point. If you find it normal to lose a lot of money/game items, don't think other people thinks the same.<br />
<br />
The key is to RESPECT each other.</div></div><hr />

If he isnt stopped somehow, he will continue doing that stuff while noone knows about it. This will at least put him in a spotlight, which is VERY WELL DESERVED.<br />
<br />
You know, Ive always whined about how mods can ban people, but they cant magically reappear everyone's cash or do something else about it. This is an idea that should be used by most people.</div></div><hr />

If hes parents even bother care about he scammed you, they probably be the only one care.<br />
Doesnt think hes friends etc would care.<br />
so the facebook group would have 3 members, you, gallars mon and dad. If even that, you probably will be the only member.<br />
Im no picking hes side, i dont like scammers ofc, but face it, a FACEBOOK GROUP about tibia scammers? affff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-28-2010, 18:34</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand how much you hate a person when he scams you. <br />
I already took several days trying to punish some scammers through law with few luck yet. International justice sucks. However if you belong to same country then your local police can do something about it. In that case go for it. Just tell the paypal email of the scammer to the police. Police will call Paypal and then paypal will have to give private data to the police (card number, ip and timestamp of the transaction is usually enough). Finally the police will be able to locate that thief and he will be punished.</div></div><hr />

By the way: wow. Blackd took a part in a thread ^.^. Seeing admin of bot-site writing in a topic is rare nowadays :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
In addition I wanne say something more about the idea...<br />
This is not only an Idea which came randomly into my mind. Within this century of hyperinternet and the overusage of it, people tend to create their own virtual identities like on facebook etc. with their own way of interpretating themselves.<br />
If you compare the virtual identity of someone to a painting, I wanne be that big fat black dot on the side of it, disturbing and destructive for the whole work of the person. <br />
<br />
I want to show his friends, that they actualy are friend with a thief. And I dont know how you think about it, but I would change my mind about a person, if I find out he scamed lots of people on more than 2000&#8364;.<br />
<br />
In addition I experienced that many firms tend to look for facebook accounts and activities of new employees. A group: People scamed by Lukasz Pelka ... wouldnt look that good. And I am offering another chance to him, because ofcause we will close the group and delete all as soon as he pays us back. <br />
<br />
Imho, it's time to put some pressure on the shoulders of these scamers in a legal and official way.</div></div><hr />

Well.. He will only need to report your group and facebook will remove it without further questions.. Only way ur group will have any chance to stay active is by having some serius proofs against gallar ^^</div></div><hr />

That's really nice.<br />
If there is a law about it, scammers are criminals. You took it to this level.<br />
Here in Brazil we have no law about internet business, so most of this ppl doesn't get punished.<br />

 <br />
So you are Gallar? Well if he scammed you show some proofs or shut ur mouth.<br />
<br />
Edited:@Timtrade Just one question, in this thread you're saying that you lost all your money. but one your other user your mentioned that you got him in court and got 50 % of your cash back so far.. I got a feeling that your full of bullshit ^^ <br />
<br />
Explain yourself and show ur innocent or i will give you a perm vacation from the forums inclueding your new account.<br />
<br />
Edit no.2: Feels to me like someone made a serius misstake unbanning this dude, already 2 guys that accuses him for taking account back before the re register. I belive those guys as the mention earlyer that he sold the characters to them and i doubt they would chargeback after this amount of days.</div></div><hr />

bought croy blackbeard slaughter at lvl 192, didn't even have him 30 days so the registration wasn't changed he gave me the confirmation key...and today i try to log in account password changed and the rk doesn't work(which means he ordered another confirmation key). Yet my house is still in tacted with HIS DECORATIONS(not mine which means it was him). i also bought the account of Vi xa but don't care as much about it as this one. And im not the only one...coincidence i think not. How can i be Gallar, im from Canada. Talked to him pretty much everyday he seemed normal then he does this.</div></div><hr />

He also had a backup story that he is going to NY to study on Saturday, coincidence? so he can't order another confirmation key or wont be home to get one if i get hacked...Don't really care anymore. I'd show proof but there is no point i wont get my money back and i doubt he cares if he is banned from this forum. I'm done with Tibia.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ontiz</div><div class="date">11-16-2010, 23:18</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings,<br />
I know I'm breaking forum rules by writing this, still I just want to explain all things, I'm sick of this and I want it all to make solved.<br />
<br />
Firstly, I never ever scammed Arvid (Tim Trade), he paid me via WU, I send cash to my delivier, and the gold has been sent.<br />
That is easy.<br />
But lets go with the rest!.<br />
<br />
TimTrade never ever calld my parents, clearly just because I'M NOT a teen, I'm in full age or however to spell it, they've got nothing to do with that!<br />
Lets go more - there is no family of mine at Facebook, nor any social portal.<br />
They just don't use any of them.<br />
Moreover, I've been not trading with TimTrade in May, but in April!<br />
Germans court also not chasing after me, they've remit the case because lack of evidence, and features of a criminal offence.<br />
Also there's a few more lies from TimTrade, e.g. that he knows where I live, what company do I run etc.<br />
<br />
What else I can say. I don't want to be unbanished, or to stay in a fully bright light as a great fair man, because I'm not. I'm not saint either. I just don't want to someone defame me &quot;just because&quot;. Also now he's saying that he doesnt want to do anything criminal. Should I remind him how did he threating me before?<br />
<br />
If there's anyone polish who wants to speak fluent english and may listen to my point of view and translate it for blackDforum, my official and last statement - I'd appreciate it.<br />
<br />
And honestly - make a group @ facebook that not a problem, just please remember that publishing my private data without a rights for using them is a crime. Also everybody already knows about TimTrade who thinks I scamd him while I'm not.<br />
<br />
Ps<br />
@Raoul: I never ever traded with you, man you must missd me someone else, I'm 1000% sure.<br />
@Hurriel: Nice try!<br />
<br />
To Moderators:<br />
Please delete my private data from the other peoples posts, as it is wrong with polish Ustawa o ochronie danych osobowych z dnia 29 sierpnia 1997 r. (Dz. U. Nr 133 poz. 883 z pó&#378;n. zmianami). and I bet some European Union rules too</div></div><hr />
