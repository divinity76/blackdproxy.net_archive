There will be a good working bot for Tibia 9.9! :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully it won't end in another stealth window that can even send impossible messages such as &quot; &quot; into the game haha.<br />
<br />
I do hope my current knights avoid the next wave if blackd will soon be undetectable.<br />
<br />
I look forward and support all improvements to the proxy and am thankful for your invested time in it :)<br />
<br />
Cmon community show your support!</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I'm not really much playing/botting Tibia anymore. Quite frankly, last 3 years were more or less constant on and off. These days I've been using BlackD Proxy for fishing only ^^. Trying to get onto the highscores with skill of 100. Lol.<br />
<br />
After that I doubt I'll be seriously playing or stuff like that. But it was sure a lot of fun till now. I mean I was once a customer when BlackD Proxy was still payable. :)<br />
<br />
Good luck with everything man!</div></div><hr />
