<br />
At this point, you should energy bomb where the monsters spawn, guess what? A loooooooot of monsters stacked in the same sqm, go back there, energy wave or exevo gran vis lux or stealth ring and exori vis and you just lvled.<br />
<br />
I lvled from 30~87 in a single day, next day cip noticed it, fixed the bug and reseted me :(</div></div><hr />

lol that was stupid of you :(. you should go level 50~ first day, then 65, 80 etc. then it isn't that much exp and pretty untraceable.<br />
<br />
only bug i know was that snowball quest at santas house, you could get like an infinite amount of snowballs. and that bug in the port hope update (i think) where you could walk into some walls and clean houses :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those things where you got snowballs from were, at V.6, something CIP placed here and there in towns (not sure if there was any outside). You right-clicked on it and a snowball popped up upon it. They stopped doing this because it made pallys able to power-game their dist easily. At santas house CIP missed a square beneath the mountain where it was supposed to be a tree so people was able to get up that way. So not really a bug :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
this isn't really a bug either, but after i logged in after an update, i tried drinking a mana fluid and got drunk ;(. i had 10+ bps of wine on me. don't know how that happened</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starry_Dreams</div><div class="date">08-27-2007, 07:47</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a really bad bug with the arena update.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you would get randomly teleported to &quot;the void,&quot; which is basically the place where creatures go after they die...don't ask me how it works, lol that's just what the CM said.<br />
<br />
Anyway, a player got teleported there and kicked from the game.   He couldn't log back in, but he was still online in the game.  So a GM tried to use his teleport function to get to him and then he got stuck too xD  They both couldn't login for days until Cip finally took care of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and also soft boots were giving something like 4x the normal regen rate in the first few days after the last update, know a few ppl who abused it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. If you shoot exevo mort hur on area and you kill a monster then teleport appear. If exevo mort hur touch teleport it will disappear.<br />
<br />
2. I was playing around with exiva kill nick command. I attacked my friend and it kept attack all the time. When he enter PZ I saw this white message &quot;This action is not permitted in protection zone&quot; even though I was far away from him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">terryo</div><div class="date">11-06-2007, 23:01</div></div><div class="posttext">One time keys were bugged where it would open up any door. I was one of the ones who got caught doing it but wasnt banned. This was when Pegramon (spelling) was To'roshak of the mercenaries or maybe even before that. Im wanting to say it was definately before 2001 or maybe 2000. Anyways, you know the strange talisman in Thais mana shop? You used to could not get them but it was missing and someone was selling it. Minobar was looted (big training place back in fib, we looted Merc tower . We didnt touch Red rose's  because we knew those guys but yeah, that was a longgg time ago. Also with enough Multiclients (After premium came out) you could place a character on each square around a house door. Log on your first character who was sitting infront of the door. HE would be teleported 1 square in (but thats as far as he went) I actually found out this because some f*cker looted my guild house and i figured out what they did.</div></div><hr />

But, it was kinda awesome. you all know how u can put boxes around a hole, and rope a monster, and it will just stack up. Well, I saw SS where people did rats like that in thais, and mintwallin, and got like 80 shielding in a couple minutes. Cause u didn't have to attack a monster to raise shielding.<br />
<br />
Well, now that I think about it, its not a bug. well, I told you anyways, for information :~ :D</div></div><hr />

Hallo, common sense? Thats the point? It lets u log out without waiting for anything. I belive it has something to do with packet manipulating or so...</div></div><hr />

The wall-bug where you could steal items aswell.. I reported this during the test server, but it didn't get fixed.. I had the craziest idea concerning that aswell, too bad I found out one day too late ;&lt;<br />
Ehm, let's see.. more bugs.. I remember the one where the item-names got fucked up, that was pretty wierd lol<br />
<br />
Oh, and there's the one where Arieswar advances from level 76 to level 130, just by killing one drag lord ^^<br />
<br />
Can't think of anything else right now, except for the ones that has been posted already<br />

<br />
Some mapper working for CipSoft decided he wanted a lil bit more paid than Guido was paying him, so he made a sword with atk:80 def:60 and hid it in a new area that was coming in an update. This sword would nowadays equal maybe a SoV or a little bit better, but at that time, when the best weapons out there were SoV and giant sword, it was a big difference. Anyways, the day after the update, Arieswar and Taghor decided to go explore the new area. The new area was the dragon lord hole in Plains of Havoc, and they tried every square on the floor with a pick to look for hidden holes. They eventually found one, and found a body with a firefield on in the corner. They DF'd it, and found the key to the nightmare tower and a plain sword. Before they left however, Arieswar looked at the sword, and saw it's whooping stats. The sword that the mapper hid for himself now belonged to him, which suited him well seeing as he really wanted to get level 100 first. He went hunting with it for some days, killing dragons really fast, but eventually word got out, he had a brief visit from guido who took the sword and told him to report any bugs when he find them. A couple of days later though, some noobie looted the sword yet again in a cyclops, messaged Arieswar, and he bought it for about 3 million i believe. Arieswar kept his leveling for a few days, until Guido visited him again, and this time took the sword and removed ALL contents of his depot. :(<br />
<br />
Nice story :]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Al Capone</div><div class="date">02-20-2008, 13:03</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a bug a long time ago when you could make game server crash and get cloned items in your depot. It was becouse character data and depo data had different save time.<br />
Crashing server was easy. You had to step on the same sqm where monster was and then shot him with an arrow. If some time ago you took your SoV from depo you could make a clone of it (it was saved in depo and on your character's backpack).<br />
<br />
Another one was summoning &quot;Mimics&quot; and &quot;Mammoths&quot; when this monsters doesn't even exist in game yet (&quot;Killed at lvl XX by Mammoth&quot;).<br />
<br />
I've also heard about bug that allows you to login with multi chars of the same account but i dont know how it worked :p<br />
<br />
Weapon shopkeeper in Port Hope had the same script that Sam in Thais and you could make &quot;Sam's old backpack quest&quot; there. It was becouse cipsoft use the same script for Thais and Port Hope weapon NPC (what a lazy ppl! :rolleyes:)<br />
<br />
And bug that allowed you to take rare yellow rose from Venore's shop table.<br />
<br />
When rookgaard was introduced you could get rooked back there and sometimes keep part of your equipment with you. Most of items (like famous scrimitar) were removed but there are rumours about some ppl still keeping mainland eq. but psst! its secret :D<br />
<br />
And more.... maby i'll add some later :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point, you should energy bomb where the monsters spawn, guess what? A loooooooot of monsters stacked in the same sqm, go back there, energy wave or exevo gran vis lux or stealth ring and exori vis and you just lvled.<br />
<br />
I lvled from 30~87 in a single day, next day cip noticed it, fixed the bug and reseted me :(<br />

remember that one, my friend used it. well alot of people used it. It was awsome ^^</div></div><hr />

Contrary to popular belief, the sword was not meant to be in the game.

Hence, &quot;excalibug.&quot;) It was discovered in the body that now is the Crystal Key quest. It was apparently placed there by a mapper so that he could secretly retrieve it and use it himself. Another one of these swords was later found in a cyclops by Taghor. They would both be a Magic Longsword if they existed today. The swords were removed from the game, and when the Magic Longsword was introduced, the stats were lowered twice, and after the second time they stuck. CipSoft presumably added excalibug as roleplaying material, and this is the story: <br />

the thing with this bug is, you can talk to most NPCs about it, just as with Ferumbras. So it hints at the fact that Cip could have wanted such a sword in-game.

Another one were the f bomb trap on gs, you could f bomb the gs so they couldnt move, then you could stand with your lvl 8 palla and bolt it untill it died.<br />

Sorry for not checking the board lately. Anyway i tested it on 8.2 and it still works since it prolly is impossible for cip to patch it the way they programmed some stuff.<br />
<br />
I dont wanna be the guy acting cool here about something i know, but if i spoil it here it will get attention and Cip will find something against it. So id like to abuse it a bit soon when i got the correct char for it :)</div></div><hr />

If you are in character list and select your character and press ok/enter. When it says connecting to gameworld etc.. press ctrl + l rapidly and DONT STOP!, when you login you'r friend can attack you once e.x Exori vis, and you get hurt, but you still logout.

it wasn't noticed for a long time until one of the guys started acting suspicous by putting alot of the items for sale, then cip reset a few of the top 10s (when top 10's meant lvl 60-70)</div></div><hr />

If you are in character list and select your character and press ok/enter. When it says connecting to gameworld etc.. press ctrl + l rapidly and DONT STOP!, when you login you'r friend can attack you once e.x Exori vis, and you get hurt, but you still logout.

Yeah, I know why. Atleast I think it is. You know when you press ctrl+l it takes like 0,3-8 sec for you to actually logout. So this is the problem. When you press the ctrl+l the client sends logout packages. And before it gets confirmed by the server that you don't got pz you get hit by your friend/enemy. You will get pz and lose hp and he will get white skull. So then when the packages that makes you logout come back. You will be logged even if you got PZ. The same thing happens when you got auto logout.</div></div><hr />

It was a bug that has been detected on the test server, but they didn't fix it.<br />
When you finished &quot;Shadows of yalahar quest&quot;, and said &quot;mission&quot; to Tales, you recived 25000 exp. But when you said &quot;mission&quot; again, you recived it again :)<br />
All you had to do is to put mission in your hotkey, and lvl up :p<br />
Mastro Daro gained level 1200~ and he went through the 999 level gate.<br />

<br />
<br />
First one, There was a player on Antica who discovered that if he killed a specific dragonlord when the server save announcement appeared on the screen, a SoV dropped by the dragon lord, after he did this so he had around 2bp SoV, He reported this bug and guess what he got as reward? you are right, A SoV.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second One. Also a Antica player found out if he where standing in his house when the server went down by the server save, and he &quot;pushed&quot; for example a golden armor on the house floor it got copied, This guy received a instant deletion for abusing this bug.</div></div><hr />

I think you could even just stand on this square and throw something under you. Would be nice to know what happened if a rookstayer and some lvl 1 stay on the same spot on this bridge, would both get teleported? :D</div></div><hr />

It's not so much a bug, as it is a feature that is prone to abuse. If you log in, and the spot you were previously in is occupied, what should the server do? It tries to send you a square meter away, beginning with the tile north of you and proceeding clockwise. And if that fails? Then there's two options, you could either keep sending the player further and further away, hoping for a clear square somewhere, or you could decide to not give a crap, and let the player stack with other players and monsters upon login. Cip instead chose that if there's no suitable spot within a square of your last logged out location, you get sent to the temple.</div></div><hr />
