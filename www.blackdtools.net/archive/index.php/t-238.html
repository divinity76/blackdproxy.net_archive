To test what happens with gms you can edit the ini and redefine the line where it says <br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
GmStartWithThis3=gm -<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
For example, if you want that people starting with &quot;bla&quot; gets considered as gm it would be:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
GmStartWithThis3=bla-<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Then for example Blackd Neo would be considered as gm.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
IMPORTANT: while this is redefined the real gms will be considered as players. (except a few gms with special names not starting with &quot;gm&quot;, wich are always considered gms, for example: Guido)</div></div><hr />
