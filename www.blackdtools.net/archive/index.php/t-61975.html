<br />
A lot of OTs use different packets for actions in their custom clients<br />
for example, if let's say the walk packet is normally 26, they might change it to 27 or something totally different. Some OT's have moved around/scrambled the packet structure totally.<br />
<br />
I've managed to make blackD work with every OT so far, but it is REALLY REALLY tedious to change all packets/packetstructures as the same code is allover the place. <br />
<br />
For example, using a rune on a creature, is coded in magebomb, warbot and the core, so making it work on all three places I must change the packets and its structure on all places. Think how much work it is to change every packet and structure needed to play/bot on Tibia for every action done by the bot multiple times and places in the source code. <br />
<br />
So basicly I would like you to make the packet structure easily configured at one place.<br />
<br />
So if use rune on X Y Z is normally for example: <br />
26 ID ID XX YY ZZ (where 26 is use item, ID = itemid,  followed by XYZ)<br />
<br />
Then some ot's have changed the order and packettype to something like this:<br />
26 XX ZZ YY ID ID<br />
Sometimes some 0's as well. <br />
<br />
I hope you understand what I mean, but making it easy to change all the packets and its structure in one place, would make it a thousand times easier to make BlackD work on any OT :)<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

i made a packet filter, that, if matched, would replace a known packet with another, <br />

<br />
etc. if it finds a packet it KNOWS has changed, it will modify it right before sending it to the client or server. then <br />
<br />
  HHBFilter packet<br />
    sckServer(Index).SendData packet<br />
<br />
<br />
    HHBFilter packet<br />
        sckClientGame(Index).SendData packet<br />
<br />
<br />
        HHBFilter goodPacket<br />
        SckClient(Index).SendData goodPacket<br />
<br />
<br />
    HHBFilter ReconnectionPacket(Index).packet<br />
    <br />
    frmMain.sckServerGame(Index).SendData ReconnectionPacket(Index).packet<br />
<br />
<br />
        frmMain.HHBFilter goodPacket<br />
        clientLess(Index).SendData goodPacket<br />
<br />
 and its working great. now no need to modify other parts of the code :p everything sent to the client or the server will go through this filter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: This example works for outcastserver.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">02-06-2016, 21:02</div></div><div class="posttext">wups, i forgot the accompanying function ComparePackets<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Private Declare Function RtlCompareMemory Lib &quot;NtDll&quot; (Source1 As Any, Source2 As Any, ByVal Length As Long) As Long<br />
<br />
Public Function ComparePackets(Packet1() As Byte, Packet2() As Byte) As Boolean<br />
Dim P1Size As Long<br />
Dim P2Size As Long<br />
P1Size = UBound(Packet1)<br />
P2Size = UBound(Packet2)<br />
If (P1Size &lt;&gt; P2Size) Then<br />
    ComparePackets = False<br />
    Exit Function<br />
End If<br />
If (P1Size + 1 &lt;&gt; RtlCompareMemory(Packet1(0), Packet2(0), P1Size + 1)) Then<br />
    ComparePackets = False<br />
    Exit Function<br />
End If<br />
ComparePackets = True<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
<br />
and here is a readable version of HHBFilter<br />
<br />
<br />
Public Function HHBFilter(ByRef Bytes() As Byte)<br />
Dim buf() As Byte<br />
  GetCheatPacket buf, &quot;cipsoft client packet hex here&quot;<br />
  If ComparePackets(Bytes, buf) Then<br />
    GetCheatPacket Bytes, &quot;custom client packet hex here&quot;<br />
    Exit Function<br />

<br />
The only problem here is that all the packet compare/replace operations might lag the connection. Before I can release this feature for public I will need to find an optimized procedure. However, for now, it is worth a sticky for people with custom ot servers.</div></div><hr />
