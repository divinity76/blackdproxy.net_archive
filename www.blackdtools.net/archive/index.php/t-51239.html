<br />
At least give me a list of what files, folders and registry keys created/modified by Blackd Proxy that I need to delete in order to manually uninstall this dangerous software that already got many of my tibian accounts deleted.</div></div><hr />

Blackd, so, you can't help on this simple issue. You don't answer any email either. <br />
<br />
Sincerely, I don't trust any of your tools anymore. <br />
<br />
I hope your Blackd proxy gets flagged by antivirus software for forcing its permanence on existing old users that refuse to pay more to get the installer - therefore not letting uninstallation happens, with potential undesirable effetcs.<br />
<br />
I'll be reporting this case in detail to all antivirus companies support mails and forums I can get.<br />
<br />
So they can then help me and other users to uninstall your proxy after BLACKLISTING it.</div></div><hr />
