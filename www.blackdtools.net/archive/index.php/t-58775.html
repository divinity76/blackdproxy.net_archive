	<meta name="description" content="Hello, 
I was wondering, is it possible with cavebot to get contents of a response from tibia server? 
I mean for example I would like to use &quot;Look at door&quot; and see if it's open. Something like getting contents of a response to this request in some variable would be cool. 
Anyone knows if that's possible with blackd tools?" />

I don't think it's a big deal and it would make possible to make a lot more advanced scripts.</div></div><hr />
