Best settings for most cases:<br />

<br />
3. Close Tibia 11, open it again, and login a player again.<br />
4. Reattach Tibia 11 to Game Cheat, and repeat only (1) so you obtain a new (different) final address.<br />
5. Go back to the obtained list in (2) and go Pointer scanner&gt;Rescan memory. Enter new final address. Enable Repeat rescan until stopped. Press ok to start filtering.<br />
6. Walk a bit,change floor and do some actions with your player. Around 15 seconds should be enough to filter a lot of address.<br />
7. Go back to the list and press &quot;Stop rescan loop&quot;. Now you should have less address.<br />
case 7a. If they are still a lot then repeat everything from point (3)<br />
case 7b. If the list is small (&lt;20 address) then test the shortest paths (less steps) that start at a .dll because they are usally the right ones. In some cases you always get a few valid path solutions.<br />
8. Test the obtained path solutions in a different computer with a different windows version, in order to discard paths that depends on operative system.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
I can't find any address. In old tibia I just:<br />
1. Open Tibia<br />
2. Log into the game<br />
3. Open cheat engine and select Tibia from processess<br />
4. Write in Cheat Engine example 3385 (ID of crown helmet) to find helmet address, next change to dark helmet and write 3844 then click next scan and I had a pointer for helmet. <br />
<br />
Now when I write 3385 I have huge list with addressess, when I change to dark helmet, change id to 3844 and click next scan i have no results...<br />
<br />
WHat im doing wrong?<br />
anyway i can't find in chean engine &quot;IMPORTANT - Settings:<br />
- Uncheck &quot;Don't include pointers with read-only nodes&quot;<br />
- Uncheck &quot;Addresses must be 32-bit aligned&quot;&quot; where is it?<br />
<br />
<br />
I found now address : 6FCC129A for helmet, is it correct? also I dont know what i click,cause nowi  cant' find them again lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-28-2016, 22:58</div></div><div class="posttext">You can find the address for the current session using old tactics.<br />
However, that address will only be valid in your machine until you close Tibia.<br />
Nowadays your goal is obtaining universal paths to obtain that dynamic address so you need to do the procedure several times [open tibia, find current address, close tibia]<br />
until you only havew few paths remaining. Such paths should work for any future session of Tibia, in any machine.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally, answering to your last question: No, there is not a single short address in tibia 11 like that. Everything are paths now.<br />
And in the case of the helmet, I could bet it is now part of a collection of equipment slots. You will need to search that collection start. However, it should be a static collection, so obtaining a path there is still possible. But you can expect it to be a very long path (maybe with 9, 10 or 11 steps)</div></div><hr />

When I try to search for any value, nothing appears, even when I enter &quot;unknown initial value&quot;. Would you help me?<br />
