	<meta name="description" content="So I was wondering if anybody capable of managing photoshop might help me out to make this 3 pictures look better. What I am looking for is for the 1st one (the one that's only text) to look cooler in a stylish way. The others I was just looking for better quality if possible. I want to make them fit my FB timeline.
