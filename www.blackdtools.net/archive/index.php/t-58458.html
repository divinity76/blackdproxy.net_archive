I downloaded the new version for tibia 9.6 and I error number 6. I got it when I opened the program and when I loaded my mana/hp configs. 
 
What's this about? Should I be concerned? 
 
It didn't crash or anything but I decided not to use it until I get a response ;)

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">07-12-2012, 01:25</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the problem happens if you have an outdated version of tibia.dat in the default tibia folder. You probably failed to update the Tibia client correctly or you downloaded a very early version of the new client.<br />
<br />
Try deleting the whole Tibia folder, download the tibia installer again from tibia.com and then reinstall it in the default folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BldMx</div><div class="date">07-12-2012, 23:41</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that the problem was that the new Tibia 9.60 installer created a Tibia folder inside the existing Tibia folder.<br />
<br />
So yeah, the safe cheats was reading the incorrect tibia.dat</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
/EDIT<br />
Well I got it working but it still shows that error just before it loads my settings properly :P Dunno why.<br />
<br />
/EDIT2<br />
Alright, now it's working as usual, no errors :) Just deleted old settings file and made a fresh one.</div></div><hr />
