Well I'm botting on a 8.5 otserver, and the cavebot is really messed up, If I take follow atk the body freezes, when I dont take follow atk the bot messes up alot, When a creature run the bot just dosent follow properly, It is like hacking after it, And the creatures runaway, Is there any way to fix these problems?
