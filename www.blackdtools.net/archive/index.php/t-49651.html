My brother uses ElfBot and didn't get ban for 6 months. He bots every day about 8h on 10 chars. I use same settings and bot and I get ban in almost each ban wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coks</div><div class="date">07-18-2010, 03:39</div></div><div class="posttext">I have about 5 different bots on my computer, I only open them on a different client for an OT server and I've survived plenty ban waves. And its obvious that I have them, I haven't modified their names at all. So I don't think that's true xd</div></div><hr />
