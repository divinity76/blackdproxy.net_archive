welcome, the title says it all, What im Trying to do is pwning the server and I need more people to do the project that is in the process, my idea is pwning DOLERA a team about 40 or 50 people, at this moment I have about 10 people in the project Need more people ... as well if you need help ill Give You waypoints and tell you WHERE to hunt! and i know this project will Take Some Time But I hope you help me own this server because i need you guys to own this server, Well i know it sounds hard but nothing is impossible and i would love to do this project... i know it will be very fun and awesome if we try to make this project... we dont need 50 to make it happen 50 would be great its part of the idea... even better if we get 100! ok guy's any suggestions... pm me or add my msn and send me a msg on msn.<br />

<br />
<br />
Ok let me present my self first... my name is pablo im from usa. ok that was fast lol ok guys the point here is to own a server and the easiest way is having a team a nice team... the server i would love to own is DOLERA. since theres not that much high level's and it would be more easier than INFERNA because INFERNA it's kind of hard... well if we own DOLERA in a future we can go to INFERNA it would be great... well on this project we need only mages sorcerer's or druid's you can be premium account or free account doesnt matter (atm)... we will try to discuss sevral things on msn or in game, and guy's i would love also you guy's to give me idea's ok, ill add screen shot's. video's. to this thread so people from these forums can see them and have fun watching our videos :) im also inviting people from other forums like blackdtools, tibiabot ng, ghost bot, magebot, i would also like you guy's to invite your friends! and remember the point here is to own this server and many more! <br />

Fun Time's:<br />
<br />
well fun time mean's for me is making quest, pking with noob chars, making wars etc... ill upload videos! from our team! doing all those fun activities. Also btw almost forgot we can make another char in another world like for an example shanera and log to lure high lvls and trap them and rush them with runes summoning monsters like mino archers etc just for fun, why we need to do that? because theres something thats called stamina and we need to log so it can load back to the time of 42, theres no need to get it to the hour of 42 but still you need to give your character a rest... so... we can log in another world just for fun :)... any other ideas message me.<br />
