	<meta name="description" content="Hey, 
 
I'm currently playing a pvp world so it's hard to make moneymakers that can bot for hours nonstop. 
 
Isn't it possible to make a rook moneymaker? 
 
I know u can only deposit 1k gold but you can leave rook with how much gold you want in your backpack, correct? 
 
If you can leave with as much gold as u want in ur backpack then it's easy! :P" />
