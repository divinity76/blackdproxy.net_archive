<br />
u need 3 chars, 1st will have fake skull<br />
<br />
1. Create party: 1st character with 2nd character<br />
2. 1st character has to take skull (atack 3rd character and stop atack immediately)<br />
3. EXACTLY after one minute (or maybe 59 seconds) after atack, 2nd character has to atack 1st<br />
<br />
Timing - thats the key to make fake skull. 2nd character has to atack 1st when her skull is blinking but its not possible to see blinking becouse you are in party and you see only green skull. <br />
<br />
<br />
HOW TO COUNT EASY?:<br />
I use this blackd cavebot script to count:<br />
<br />
I load this script for 2nd character and join to pt with 1st and 2nd<br />
Just after 1st character hit 3rd character with gran vis lux bot count to 59 and atack 1st character in perfect time<br />
XXX-first char<br />
<br />
<br />
IfTrue ($lastmsg$#string=#exevo gran vis lux) Goto 2<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
waitX 59<br />
fastExiva kill XXX<br />
<br />
<br />
I discovered that bug much time agoe by myself :S U can take that skull, enter and leave pz, travel by ships and kill ppl who take yellow skull on you and you wont have pz lock</div></div><hr />
