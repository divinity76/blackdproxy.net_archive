	<meta name="description" content="Hey there, community. I actually just downloaded this software and looking around it looks like a beautiful program but I am having a problem.. I don't think it is working at all for me right now... 
 
I don't see the exp in the title and I tried adjusting the light intensity so I don't have to waste my time with torches and nothing is really seeming to work.. 
 
anyone around who could help me out quick? I'd appreciate it. 
 
Thank you." />
