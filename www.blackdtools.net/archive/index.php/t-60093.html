I've read this forum and read about what not do to do not get banned like not using exiva. That you should write your own bot scripts.. not use mage bomb etc.

<br />
And I was always monitoring my character when botting too.. and never saw any game master , no player ever bothered me etc.<br />

And I only botted like 5% of the entire time I was playing.. most of the time I hunted without botting.<br />
<br />
I don't understand how the hell I get banned..<br />
But all the lvl 100+ never get banned.. and they bot so hardcore and obviously compared to me.. I don't make it obious like them.<br />
I have killed lvl 60+ and  80+ botters which takes like an entire hour because they have so many pots.. they are completely afk without alarms and i also always report them too with a message like &quot;im killing an afk botter right now, will probably take an hour because he is so high lvl, come fast!&quot;<br />
<br />
How come these players dont get banned.. I think tibia is completely corrupt and game masters defend botters.<br />
I think thats why they banned me because I was making a lot of legit reports.<br />
<br />
tibia sucks.</div></div><hr />

I guess these so called &quot;safe scripts&quot; aren't so safe after all xD. Any explanation?</div></div><hr />

For now please stick to Blackd Safe Cheats because Blackd Proxy is very detectable at this moment.</div></div><hr />
