He means the patch.exe<br />
<br />
but I don't think that's how they detect botters... I have it and I am still not banned with elfbot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raonikct</div><div class="date">02-12-2010, 05:22</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats why they probably gets enough data to be 100% sure before releasing a ban to each user, if so they wouldnt ban instantly. But i've been using blackd for 3 months and nothing happend, no bans at all, mc'ing 3 chars (not all the time through).</div></div><hr />

I fail to see anyone disproving my theory as me and one other person are the only people who have removed patch.exe and we still remain unbanned.<br />
<br />
P.S I didn't read the 41 pages of comments as there was no point, I have read enough threads directed at banishments, everyone flames my technique yet I remain unbanned and noone will try it.</div></div><hr />

Most likely you are just lucky but I haven't really looked into it. I'm having a hard time believing that there's much you can do with your computer to avoid getting banned with bots without proper safe function.</div></div><hr />

Proof? <br />
<br />
Your no evidence vs me being unbanned kinda makes you lose =[<br />
<br />
Theory on massbans (Not mine) <br />
<br />
People are saying something about logging in and seeing a &quot;downloading new object&quot; for like 1 second and if they see this they get banned next wave.<br />
<br />
~This theory linking in with mine is PATCH.EXE DOES THE DOWNLOADING OF NEW INFO TO THE CLIENT <br />
<br />
Anyone wanting to disprove me, delete patch.exe today and start a new account that hasn't already been logged for banishment and get botting =]</div></div><hr />

I deleted that like 5 months ago, and got banned on december on all the accounts I was playing with. Yes, I remembered to delete it when I downloaded the new update aswell.</div></div><hr />

  Im right now using blackd, blackd mc, elf bot,tried other bots as well for experimental purposes. I have never banned. I have like more than 15-20 different account in different worlds,<br />
4-5 of them main, other chars noob accounts. Was botting with them most of time. None of them banned. Using  X-ray fuction, m wall timers, auto healing, cave bot, most function of huds, icons,  hotkeys, shortkeys. Didnt remove patch.exe<br />
  I dont play more than 7-8h a day. But recently since like 1 week, i stopped using bot except for battles. Because everybody started to get ban and im afraid.</div></div><hr />
