It surely opens letter but you have to enter (copy/paste) reciver and town and then click on 'OK' manually.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how this could be by passed aka purely done by some sort of a script or as said before ... packets recording ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks so much if anyone has any kind of useful idea.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />
