I've purchased gold using the same paypal account and sending to the same character/account from as far back as 2010. Am I still required to verify or can I skip this step?

Just upload an image with a text saying &quot;Alrededy purchased something in the past&quot;, then I will verify it in my old database.</div></div><hr />
