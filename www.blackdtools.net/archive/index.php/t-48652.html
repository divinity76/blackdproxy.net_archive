Today i would like to know something more about the idea of a guild bank. 
I know that they are mainly used in wars when ppl die they can pay their blessings with the guild's cash and stuff. 
 
But my questions are like:

Today i would like to know something more about the idea of a guild bank.<br />
I know that they are mainly used in wars when ppl die they can pay their blessings with the guild's cash and stuff.<br />
<br />
But my questions are like:<br />
Does the guild bank get filled by a monthly fee dropped by every member ?<br />
( i guess yes) Is the amout the same for everyone or does it depend on a members level ?<br />
<br />
how about hunts payed with guild cash ?<br />
Does the loot (profit) go to the guild bank so ppl with too less cash for hunting with well exp can use guild cash for exping, but have to drop the profit into the bank ?<br />
<br />
Well i could drop some more questions like this but for now these are my main questions.<br />
<br />
I would also greet any kind of hint what to do with guild cash ect.<br />
like how to use it for quest cleaning ect.<br />
<br />
thanks yours,<br />

Since my guild is mainly a war guild, the money we got in our guild 'bank' is mainly from war payments, which we only give to our poor members who needs blessings/supplies whenever there's a war.</div></div><hr />

If ur poor the leader gives u money from guildbank to exp,and the profit goes into the bank, also we got alot of money from warpayments random PA,etc.<br />

Thank you two so for your answers.<br />
As my memers are about level 30-60 a war wouldn't be good yet &lt;hehe&gt;<br />
but a payment for vent or sth sounds pretty good.<br />
Sending ppl with guild cash on hunts but to pay profit seems to be nice as well :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nostrax</div><div class="date">02-20-2010, 16:20</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild asks a 20k/monthly fee just to bring up the guildcash if something happens. So we are ready to war and so on, also we do not use it for quest services.. Since if u hold a quest u should pay the supplies from the payments. And the profit u make will go into the guildbank.<br />
<br />
Also we pay 10k/monthly to the owner of the ventrilo. He pays real cash for it and so on, just a little payment for him.<br />
