After almost exactly a year since last Faloria server went offline after being online for 8 months (December 2012 - August 2013) with 99% uptime, we are now back with a more polished server and a eager to satisfy the community once again with a stable and professionally handled server!<br />
<br />
Are you looking for a good fight, or do you just want to revive some old memories in the lands of 7.4 Tibia? Then this should be the perfect place for you!<br />
<br />
Server is launching this Sunday, 14/9, at 18.00 GMT+1!<br />

<br />
Experience rates<br />
<br />
Since our experience table is a bit special, there is no static experience stage as on most other servers. People who played other versions and/or Mastercores might remember that you got 1x experience from the monsters, but less experience was needed per level. A full experience table can be seen on the live website.<br />
<br />
For example, when you are level 8, you will gain levels 34 times faster then on real-Tibia<br />
<br />
 At level 15 it will be 24x faster.<br />
 Level 50, 6x faster experience.<br />
 Level 100, 3.2x faster experience.<br />
 Level 200, 1.6x faster experience.<br />
<br />
PvP config<br />
<br />
 You need 4 frags for Red Skull.<br />
 When you get 6 frags, you get banished.<br />
 Each frag lasts for 12 hours.<br />
 Banishment for excessive killing will last one week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only two people will get a frag per kill. The one who gets the last hit and the one dealing most damage.<br />
<br />
Golden Account features<br />
<br />
<br />
 Light in client - Like having utevo gran lux constantly activated<br />
 Deal with Djinn Npcs - All you need is golden account and level 30 to trade with them in Ankrahmun<br />
 Party Exp Bonus - If you are in party, you will gain experience bonus for each killed creature<br />
 1% less exp/item loss - You will always lose 1% less exp/skill/items when dying<br />
 All outfits<br />
<br />
We strife after an experience as authentic to the old era as possible, and do not alter with custom items or vocations.<br />
So what are you waiting for? Create an account ('http://www.faloria.eu/account/create') now and prepare yourself for an epic adventure!<br />
<br />
Hope you're as excited as us, and that we see each other on Sunday at 18.00 GMT+1!</div></div><hr />
