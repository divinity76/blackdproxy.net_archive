Thank you for your help in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sagi</div><div class="date">12-13-2015, 17:41</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes - just downloaded it to check it and there is exactly the same problem as with NG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fajfer</div><div class="date">12-13-2015, 18:26</div></div><div class="posttext">So me and my friend got the same problem. Im posting in this thread to make it fresh, and get notifications.<br />
<br />
(can't connect while blackd working) <br />
Can open it in another order, and then I can connect but nothing works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sagi</div><div class="date">12-14-2015, 09:35</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried everything I found at this forum - nothing have been solving this matter. Idk why but it seems to be something in blackd Proxy NG with trigger auto raising security levels at my computer. After something like 2 minutes I bypass this matter - adding ng to clean lists, dropping a lil bit security levels etc. It's a lil bit strange because it just mean someone try to take my data out of me - I have a few scripts blocking such a thing and they never have done a false positive signal with any bot - that's the first time.<br />
<br />
So Fajfer try to do some of those things - maybe something out of it will help you (credits to other forums users) :<br />
<br />
1) drop your security level in your user account so the program can read/write in his own path. Your windows will act more like Windows XP after that. And in my opinion that is good for 99% of the users.<br />
2) change TOOSLOWLOGINSERVER_MS=500 to value =5000<br />
3) add blackd proxy at clean list at windows firewall - it stand as tibia.exe <br />
4) it can be tibia login server problem so just go to proxy menu and select a different login server (typing address there by yourself, port is 7171)<br />
<br />
<br />
There is many more but I can't found it or remember right now - sorry about that. Don't forget not only antyvirus can block your bot - windows can do it as well so honestly if you know what you are looking for it's a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
Good luck with solving your matter.<br />
<br />
PS. This thread can be marked as solved. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
