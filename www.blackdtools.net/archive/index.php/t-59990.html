Ok here goes, I couldn't find the answer and I don't have too much time to search around,  whenever I'm chasing a fleeing monster or a ranged monster my char seems like he bounces back to where he was and so it makes it REALLY hard to get to the monster and finish it ...

Well I admit, cavebot is kind of choppy and circles target or goes to that spot where creature was when it first attacked it, but for me it doesn't 'kick back' as you described ... Hmmm, perhaps it has to do something with your client's options.<br />
<br />
Options -&gt; General -&gt; Auto Chase Off [checked]<br />
<br />
This way it only follows with bot intervenction and not with the client itself as well.<br />
<br />
Other than that ... I have no idea. But yeah, I agree that cavebot following is kind of choppy. :|</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the reply, yea it is choppy .. BTW after doing what you said ... (auto chase...) It hasn't changed  the behaviour so I guess it's not that. I used ElfBot before and I don't know if Blackd has a function that goes like this: If follow is not on then Follow on.      &lt;- So if by some reason the client changed the follow status it would put it back to follow on ... Hope you understand what I'm trying to say ... And of course I'd like to know if there's something like that that I can put on my cave bot so the client is always on follow mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarthario</div><div class="date">03-29-2013, 02:36</div></div><div class="posttext">I have exactly the same problem of our friend above. I put my moneymaker to bot at Orc Fortress but when target Orc Shaman/Orc Spearman the character just can't reach the monster... it's like if the character took a step forward and after he walks back to where he was... is impossible to reach the monster and kill... I don't know what to do in relation to this... I checked the box and is CHECKED to not automatic follow... I really don't know what to do... my moneymakers are stopped :(... can somebody find a answer to that shit? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tony32</div><div class="date">03-29-2013, 18:49</div></div><div class="posttext">Setting auto-chase to ON and changing the Cavebot timer to a higher value often sovles the &quot;jump back&quot; effect for me. Fiddle around with the cavebot timer and you will find something that works fine. If you are using to low timer value (fast) it bugs out a lot in my experience.</div></div><hr />
