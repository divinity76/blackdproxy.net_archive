	<meta name="description" content="Hello! 
 
When neobot forums were online, I found and used a thread explaining how to do it, but the forums are down and I don't remember how to make independent tibia clients and make the configs (hotkeys) stay on each client. 
 
I had 8 different clients and they all saved the hotkeys each time. 
 
On C:/ there was files called: Knight, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer. And shortcuts to the desktop. When I was playing knight.exe and had hotkeys saved as knight. 
 
Cam't just remember how to do it," />
