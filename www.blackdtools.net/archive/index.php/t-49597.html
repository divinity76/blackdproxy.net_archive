<br />
Edit: I just felt a little offended by your racist statement, so I guess you should take a week off all on my own!<br />
<br />
User Rowhan has been banned until 04-10-2010 13:00</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even tho you have had some problems with people in the forums, I somehow &quot;know&quot; that you wouldnt scam anyone :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kvra</div><div class="date">04-03-2010, 19:57</div></div><div class="posttext">And now back to the topic, Satanás banned you so he might know the whole story going on. Anyways, by checking the bans it's said that you've scammed around 6.8KK not just a k, more likely to say 6.8m but whatever.<br />
<br />
Just wait for Satanás reply then.</div></div><hr />

Haha yea it was funny last night i went on the forums, and i saw &quot;banned for scamming 6.8kk from ExiBer or something&quot; That was funny. I kinda have been away from tibia, forums ng/blackd since my characters were deleted. <br />
I have been kinda racist, kinda cocky, kinda insulted a bunch of people here I have been banned by webber for being racist/an ashoole, many people hate me but to be honest i have never scammed anyone on this forum or in ngs forum.</div></div><hr />

But still i didnt scam that guy and its kinda obvious i didnt. I hope this gets solved since i havent done anything wrong at all.<br />
<br />

<br />
I've told you 3 times just today to wait and we could get this solved together, but once again you create another topic and tell people that I hated you, if I see another post from your user regarding your banishment again I'll be sure it will be your last.<br />
<br />
Your banishment is not able for discussion, this is between you and me.<br />
<br />
Wait until I get in home and you contact me on msn, I'm advicing you for the last time.<br />
<br />
Thread closed.<br />
<br />
Also, I have banned your other user and I'd like to keep it this way until I don't talk to you on msn.</div></div><hr />
