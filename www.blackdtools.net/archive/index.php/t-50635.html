How it works: 
Someone give you a link (in this case, up /\ - it's just a demo, dont worry! xD). 
U click the link, then you switch to another tab in your browser... 
after a while, the site u entered at first has changed to something that looks like Gmail. 
 
And u know why its so scary?" />

How it works:<br />
Someone give you a link (in this case, up /\ - it's just a demo, dont worry! xD).<br />
U click the link, then you switch to another tab in your browser...<br />
after a while, the site u entered at first has changed to something that looks like Gmail.<br />
<br />
And u know why its so scary?<br />
1. When u login at what u think is gmail. U will be redirected to the real page (because you were probably already logged in in the first place) and u won't notice a thing. Your passwords has already been sent to some n00b d00d who wants to steal ur mails! (this works for banks etc to, so be careful)<br />
2. It works on all browsers, and on Windows/Mac~<br />
3. It can check what site u visits often and then make a fake page of it, <br />
so if your online bank site shows up in a tab in your browser, but you cant remember entering the site urself, close it to be safe!<br />
<br />
What do u think, would u fall for it?</div></div><hr />
