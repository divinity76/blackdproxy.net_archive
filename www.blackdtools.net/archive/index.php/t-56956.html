This is not a hack link, if you don't trust me you can simply visit official site (zezeniaonline.com) but I would be really happy if you'd do it on my link. <br />
<br />
Now to those who have not tried this, nor havent heard about it.<br />
<br />
Zezenia is quite familiar to old tibia times, but it lacks some popularity, come in and try it out!<br />
<br />
LINK VVVVVVVVVV<br />
<br />
zezeniaonline.com/home/index/referral/51452.html<br />
<br />
(this link will lead you to official site with my code, just click on &quot;account&quot; and &quot;register&quot; , everything else should be obvious.)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Had no problems with the spawns as there wasnt enough peoples filling them, but the exp was to slow for me.. well goodluck !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soyola</div><div class="date">01-08-2012, 00:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the main + of this game is pvp, so if you can 'force yourself to grind' (some people like to exp tho) for a few days and get a level, you can join warside and have some fun.</div></div><hr />
