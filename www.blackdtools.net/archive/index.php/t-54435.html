This is perhaps one of my best/most complex scripts I've released. I decided to make it public because in the server that I hunt the tarantula spawns are crowded with so many boters (I assume using other programs). Here it is, enjoy! and please comment on it. <br />
<br />
This script has been remade for version 8.71 and using the latest BlackdProxy. Please not that when new updates come I will make sure to update and verify that no hex packets have changed to make sure it is safe and I will update the version number. Use at your one risk if you are using a newer Tibia version.<br />
<br />
What it does?<br />
Kills Tarantulas, loots eggs, money and steel helmets, deposit loot when no capacity, kills hide when 300 tarantulas are killed and refills mana/health potions when needed. Also you can make it so it avoids a particular tarantula cave if its taken by someone else.<br />
<br />
How to use it?<br />
Download both the script and conditional events. <br />
Load the script and if you have already started the task change the 0 in this line: <br />
 fastExiva _taskstarted = 0  to a 1 and put the number of tarantulas that you have already killed in this line: <br />
<br />
fastExiva _counter = 0 <br />
Load the conditional events (do no change them at all).<br />
Start hunting!<br />
<br />
If any cave is taken you change tell your character not to hunt there by changing the 0 to a 1 in any of these lines:<br />
<br />
 fastExiva _caveonetaken =0<br />
fastExiva _cavetwotaken =0<br />
fastExiva _cavethreetaken =0 <br />
<br />
Note: I only killed the Hide once and it ran fine, but since I haven't been able to test it please make sure you are watching the first time you run it. Also please make sure to tell me the IDs of any other of the hide loots since I am not sure if I added them all. If it runs fine let me know so I can edit this post and   this comment. Sometimes it might take random walks, but be patient it works.<br />
<br />
Feedback<br />
All feedback is welcomed, including ways to make it better.<br />
If any errors, they will be fixed as soon as reported.<br />
