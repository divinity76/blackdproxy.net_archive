<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">09-14-2016, 11:46</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that is a good question. Updating everything for Tibia 11 would require several months of hard investigation over that new client.<br />
I guess I will start updating the smaller cheat tools, then I will try to fix Blackd Proxy. However it can take months, and I don't guarantee anything here. If I fail to update it then Blackd Proxy will be left as a bot only for OTs with version below Tibia 11.0</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-12-2016, 12:28</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I already managed to complete a system that will allow Tibia 11 connection through my proxy. That is a big step. The core of Blackd Proxy 41.0 is now ready for Tibia 11.<br />
The protocol is exactly the same than Tibia 10.98 so that will save me a lot of time. However I still need to do many big tasks so I can reenable the cavebot (it depends on a few memory addresses and maps)<br />
<br />
But, for now I am very happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">klusbert</div><div class="date">10-12-2016, 23:38</div></div><div class="posttext">Nicely done!! Was it hard figure it out? I've not spend so much time in tibia 11 but it seems like a real mess.<br />
<br />
Jumping between many liberies, and pointers all over. Have not found any static addresses at all.<br />
<br />
Btw I was thinking of just read all map from packets, maybe that is the way to go? Read fullmap on login and then read all map packets.<br />
<br />
And playerHp mana etc can you read from packets? And even player location if you got the mappackets working.<br />
<br />
Take a look in the flash client, you have all structures there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-13-2016, 00:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Reverse engineering takes a lot of time, but it is easier when you discover the full power of Cheat Engine.<br />
<br />
I already wrote some tutorials about Tibia 11 in my programmers subforum here (http://www.blackdtools.net/forumdisplay.php?7-Programmer-s-corner)<br />
<br />
Yes, you can obtain map, hp, mana and everything from packets. However, you need to read tiles correctly first. For now I am using Tibia 10.98 old dat file, but it will be outdated soon so I need to build a parser for the new tile file.<br />
I also need to rebuild map reader and I need a new virtual mini map clicker function to do moves by memory. Then Blackd Proxy will be 100% completed.<br />
<br />
About flash client: Yes, it might have some common structures. However, reading memory in a flash client is probably much harder. I have no interest in making a bot for flash, but whenever I find guides about it I always take a look in case I can learn something new there.</div></div><hr />

I ment to decompile the swf file you can see all packet structures, use a program like this. http://www.sothink.com/product/flashdecompiler/<br />
And you will find the swf file here https://secure.tibia.com/flash-regular-bin/catalog-client.xml</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bmvr</div><div class="date">10-16-2016, 01:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Blackd, can you share the source code you are currently working with? If you share it, I'll try to take a look at my free time. I'm pretty good with programming (c# .net) so vb won't be much different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-25-2016, 18:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Blackd Proxy is now updated for Tibia 10.99 and Tibia 11.01<br />
