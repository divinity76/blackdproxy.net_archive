<br />
I hope you enjoy this script.<br />
This script was re-scripted for version 8.71 and all packets are updated.<br />
<br />
<br />
What it does?<br />
This script will take a new character and level it to level 8 and log out in Destiny Island.<br />
<br />
How does it do it?<br />
This script will make the character hunt for food to make cash in order to buy decent equipment before starting to hunt.<br />
After it reaches the specific amount of golden coins it buys all the equipment and then begins hunting in AlDee cave from level 1 through 4. When it reaches level 4 it then goes hunting on the Northern part of the island since it is faster than hunting rats until level 8.  <br />
<br />
What does it kill?<br />
For Money: Pig<br />
 Deer<br />
 Sheep<br />
 Rabbit<br />
<br />
Levels 1-4: Rats<br />
 Cave Rats<br />
<br />
Levels 4-8: Spider<br />
 Poison Spider<br />
 Wolves<br />
 Deer<br />
 Bugs<br />
 Snakes<br />
<br />
<br />
What equipment does it buy in rook? Backpack<br />
 Sabre<br />
 Leather Armor<br />
 Leather Legs<br />
 Wooden Shield<br />
 Studded Helmet<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Comments<br />
<br />
 This script was designed so it can hunt in the area where the pigs and sheep are. Do not worry about it getting trapped with the gates as it will not happen.<br />
 It was decided that the wolves cave will be avoided since while testing it was found that even characters of level 7 or 8 can die when sorrounded by 3-5 wolves. <br />
 Some part of the script where taken from Arne's Script (http://blackdtools.net/showthread.php?t=34020), but everthing in the script was tested carefully. Thanks Arne!<br />
 It was noted that although it will get experience faster the character will not loot as many golden coins as other scripts where it just hunts rats but the purpose of this script was to get it to the mainland fast, after all 600 gps are easier to get there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instructions<br />
1. Create a new character.<br />
2. Login in Tibia.<br />
3. Skip Tutorial.<br />
4. As soon as you appear in the rook temple, start script.<br />
Note:Do touch anything else; it will do everything for you. Just make sure Blackd is running actively in the client. Warning: Do not open the bag/backpack.<br />
<br />
Feedback<br />
All feedback is welcomed, including way to make it better.<br />
It has been tested with many characters and is still under testing (although there shouldn't be any errors). If any errors, they will be fixed as soon as reported.<br />

<br />
And I've one question - Is it possible to switch waypoints in BlackD (like in Elfbot, from 1st waypoint to 22nd?)</div></div><hr />

You can arrange them how ever you want but just make sure that teh waypoints are accessible.</div></div><hr />

Tested up until selling food gained from rabbits.<br />

Ofcourse still the credits go to the original creator :)<br />
And I'm not responsible for any errors while/after using this script.<br />

Same. ;S<br />
When my char gets 150gp's from selling food, it goes to Al Dee's and drops his items on floor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wille61</div><div class="date">01-11-2012, 18:01</div></div><div class="posttext">The script is outdated :/ I think it is that you cant put money in the arrow slot anymore so the script dosen't manage to buy a backpack.. I think the easiset way to fix this is to make the script throw out everything execpt the bag and hunt with that instead of a backpack.. Will take a little more longer time to take lvl 8 because the bot need to deposit gold often but it will take like max 5min longer to get lvl 8 so not that huge problem imo :)</div></div><hr />

It's very unsafe and will guarantee a ban in the next wave.<br />
<br />
EDIT: After another look it also looks like anyone who's used it could expect a ban too, because of bad packetformating.</div></div><hr />

Was the packet formatting wrong since the beginning? or became invalid with updates?<br />
<br />
I want to make sure to avoid such things in the future if possible.</div></div><hr />
