People are not using it properly-there is a request section. 
 
I would like to see it cleaner and the rules should be enforced. Its a kinda hard to look for scripts in that section with so many requests in there. 
 
Thank you!!" />

<br />
Sorry I just don't look in the script section anymore<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
unlesss someone got there before me it is actually not as bad as you make out. Many people post versions of their own scripts and ask for help which I see no problem with as their copy does infact work.</div></div><hr />
