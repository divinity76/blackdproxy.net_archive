<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">09-23-2010, 06:33</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh well here I go:<br />
<br />
A mean is the sum of n values, divided by n. In this case we have a mean of 30 years, which can be written as:<br />
<br />
mean= sum / 30 = 3.79<br />
<br />
In here, sum= 113.7<br />
<br />
Where sum is the total sum of each year's inches of rain. Now, we want the mean to go up to 3.81 (an increase of 0.02). That yields:<br />
<br />
sum/ 31= 3.81<br />
<br />
And in here, sum= 118.11<br />
<br />
Bear in mind we are dividing by 31 because we are counting another year.<br />
<br />
So, we need to know that extra value, which should be above the average (so it increases the mean by 0.02 inches).<br />
<br />
All we gotta do is take our second sum, and substract the first sum, that will mean we are substracting 31 different values for the next year less 30 values from the actual 30 years, that substraction will give us one value, which is the value of the 31th year:<br />
<br />
118.11-113.7= 4.41 inches<br />
<br />
Feel free to correct me, and thanks, I hope you understood it well.</div></div><hr />
