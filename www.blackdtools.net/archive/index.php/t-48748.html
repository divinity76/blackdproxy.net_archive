Yet, makes Tibia playable without the risk of getting banned.<br />
Plus it's been proving itself to be safe. So I'd play with BSC instead of getting banned using BDP ^^</div></div><hr />

it doesn't have any kind of cavebot yet so it's kinda worthless for most people :(</div></div><hr />

yep its quite pointless using bot to heal, it just makes your skills to heal without a bot go bad day after day, or bot with all the functions or play manuallly, maybe looter is the exception</div></div><hr />
