	<meta name="description" content="Hello, 
Last time i wrote simple healer based on hotkeys which only reads memory of tibia client process so probably it should be undetectable (something like BSC), but first before releasing it i want be sure 100 % that nobody will be banished. So why i look for some beta testers who want to test it with their noob chars. Now i don't have so much time to play and test so why i turn to you with this proposal. If you are interested please write pm or email me elmicool@gmail.com.

PS<br />
I know that you can suppose that it can contain keylogger or some other shit but i stress that this proposal for willing persons. Application is written in C# so if you have VB Studio 2008 i can send you raw code to compile (but i don't prefer this way ).</div></div><hr />
