 <br />
Because this fact please understand that it is important to review the scripts with custom packets after each Tibia update. Avoid using them after a Tibia update until we review them!<br />
 <br />
The scripts posted here should be safe until Tibia update something in the protocol. If they update the format of packets then we will edit or remove the scripts that were using the modified packet types. However that might take some days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your script contain lines with exiva &gt; or exiva &lt; then better stop using that script if cipsoft release a big update. At least until we can review such scripts.<br />
 <br />
Anyways I will try to make some additional commands soon so people don't need to use such special raw commands.</div></div><hr />

I've checked with old packets and the server still accepts them, and if I trace the packet using the Proxy tool it is different. <br />
I know in which characters I've done this so lets wait and see what happens.<br />
<br />
I am working on a list of commonly used packets to check then after each update. ;)</div></div><hr />
