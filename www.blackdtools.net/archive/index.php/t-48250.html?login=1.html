	<meta name="description" content="Whenever I play World of Warcraft, my fans kick on and after a while my computer shuts down. I never had a problem with this before. It just started happening about 3 weeks ago and progressively gotten worse. There is no other weird sounds. I also installed a new graphics card about a year ago if that matters. Here are my computer specs.  I also keep my computer pretty cool.  Now my graphics card requires a power supply of 300w but mine is a 250w.  Would that 50w really make a big deal?
