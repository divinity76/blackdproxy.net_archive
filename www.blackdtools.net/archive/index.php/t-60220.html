<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">04-04-2013, 18:39</div></div><div class="posttext">The closest thing you can find to a UK owned pvp server is going to a BR/POL owned pvp server that allow English speakers to play in a neutral guild.<br />
<br />
I'm from the UK and because I speak English I cannot leave pz on many worlds including Premia. But currently I am trying out a world Berylia where it seems to have no random PKers so guildless/neutrals can bot in peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramo</div><div class="date">04-06-2013, 13:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, thanks for the heads up - hear there are lots of Spanish on berylia?<br />
<br />
Couple of us are going to join with some swes on Nova and see if we can do anything.. looks doubtful though as they are literally like ants... Guess most of the UK players quit ages ago!</div></div><hr />

If you are spanish then I recommend you to ask that question at Tibiahispano.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramo</div><div class="date">04-06-2013, 14:42</div></div><div class="posttext">well, I'm half spanish half uk, so looking for either I guess. <br />
<br />
Cheers for the advice</div></div><hr />
