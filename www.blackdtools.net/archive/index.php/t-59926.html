But what the hell? Why are this kind of threads coming from forum accounta that aren't even a month old? Why is no one who's been here for the past year or past FEW years hacked?<br />
<br />
Are you sure it's only BlackD? No Teamspeak, no Ventrilo, no Skpyin with friends? All these can provide your IP to a hacker and if your system isn't secured with a strong firewall, then they can get into your system EASILY and probably take some more than just Tibia 'gold' lol.</div></div><hr />

he obviously can't understand that &quot;open source&quot; means that everybody can have a look on the code, check that it is safe, and even recompile it to generate the exe again. It is impossible to hide any virus there. I even include the code of the dll and the code of the installer script. <br />

If you really got hacked you should consider that someone got your recovery key, you are not the original owner of the account (that happens if bought your account), you shared the account or you really have a virus (but the virus is in the boot sector, in your pirated cd of windows, or in other tool that you are sure that it is safe, but it is not)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rowhan</div><div class="date">01-18-2013, 23:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Open source means that the actual code for the program is open to public, if you don't want to install the .exe directly, you can use a compiler to turn the open source code into your own .exe. This asures that there are no malicious things in the program since you're free to inspect the code by youself.<br />
<br />
Tl:dr: All legit, probably got hacked from something else like a malicious ventrilo file or something like that.</div></div><hr />

Blackd is a legit company, and the source code for the entire bot is available for everyone to download and verify. If you&#8217;re paranoid you could even generate the .exe yourself after checking the source code. There is no way you got hacked by using Blackd. Stop trolling this forum.</div></div><hr />
