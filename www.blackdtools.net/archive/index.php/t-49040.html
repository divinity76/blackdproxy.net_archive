Before BlackD I was using NG and as I remember correct, everything was ok. Then I purchased BlackD and of course I wanted to bot like crazy with Cavebot.

Before BlackD I was using NG and as I remember correct, everything was ok. Then I purchased BlackD and of course I wanted to bot like crazy with Cavebot. I learned (or is it learnt? who knows lol!) how to set up Cavebot so I was botting quite successfuly, but I noticed that BlackD cavebot &quot;moves&quot; so damn slow ... dunno, but other botting programs run so smoothly compared to BlackD ...<br />
<br />
What am I missing? Is there any special function in BlackD to make Cavebot faster - switching between Cavebot checkpoints faster and so on?!<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the answers!<br />
<br />
P.S.: No I'm not the expert in BlackD, so that's why I'm asking this.</div></div><hr />

The only function i think its super slow if the fisher...anyways, have you tried to setoldlootmode=1?<br />
You can also enter the script line &quot;chaotic moves&quot; (you can find on your cave bot menu). It will skip near by wpts and making walks much faster.</div></div><hr />

Using old looting mode for my entire BlackD career so that's not the problem ...<br />
<br />
I'll try to add those chaotic moves in my script, I'll let you all know how it works.</div></div><hr />

Witch is 2 seconds. So you can't do anything. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
