They say they can check the full convo but I'm sure they can't just complain about it...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">01-22-2011, 17:01</div></div><div class="posttext">For what you have said, Cip had fair reasons to give you a ban. However, you can use the complain function and explain that they did not understand properly what were you trying to say.<br />
Notice that they can check big part of your conversation log, so, if you haven't said anything wrong, which includes admit botting, sharing, you have good chances to get rid of it.<br />
Tell then that you were hunting, got lots of loot and even with the death, you still got profit. Also aware then about the fact in no part of the conversation you admitted the use of bot.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps to reach a solution for your problem.</div></div><hr />

I got banned for saying &quot;selling bot&quot; mistyped boh ONCE. I did say selling boh before and after it, even said to a guy who asked for bot that I mistyped and I was selling boh. 5 days later I got banned for it and after 3 long emails they said they wouldn't remove the ban after reviewing my case 2 times... Really annoying, they are morons.</div></div><hr />
