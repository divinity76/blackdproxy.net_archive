Well, at least is what i can see from other threads. However we do not guarantee full safety from the proxy. My advice is to use the bot only on accounts that you don't care about and never on your main account. <br />
You can also use some 100% safe cheats, Blackd Safe Cheats, which contains auto healing, x-ray and some other functions. Those are already included if you decide to renew your Blackdtools licence.<br />
Hope it helps!</div></div><hr />
