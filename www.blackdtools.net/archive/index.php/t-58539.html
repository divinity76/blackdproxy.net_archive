I think this bot is invisible to Tibia's cheat detector unless you use really crappy scripts</div></div><hr />

Anyways I won't guarantee anything yet.<br />
<br />
I could bet that more than 95% of the deletions today was because other bots.</div></div><hr />

I was unlucky this time around....Not sure what script of mine got me banned/deleted.</div></div><hr />

When I throw spears, randomly the light background goes on and off... <br />
<br />
Also have a knight that i used scripts and he was perfectly fine, but pali got banned, and I was just manually hunting..zz<br />
<br />
Also, when I pause the bot, to open deport or market,, The bot says it is having an error of some kind. But once I resume the all actions it seems to be fine.<br />
<br />
that look like you was using an outdated version of blackd proxy. When you get errors you should report them to me by email asap in case they are not already fixed in latest version of blackd proxy. It is a good idea to check blackd tools download page every day to check for updates. Updated Blackd Proxy = less chances for detection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jumse</div><div class="date">07-26-2012, 03:42</div></div><div class="posttext">i got banned yesterday,  was using my own script for cavebot that was pretty basic just hunting and looting.  Not too sure what went wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bistets</div><div class="date">07-26-2012, 03:53</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I got ban too.<br />
But look<br />
<br />
I was botting with 4 knights JUST 2 got ban.<br />
<br />
2 knights I bot 2 days after the last mass ban (march or april)<br />
and stop playing 3 weeks before mass ban (PACC ACC). Them when I went to check today. No ban<br />
<br />
2 knights I bot 2 weeks before this last mass ban<br />
Just this last 2 knights have got delete. (FREE ACC)<br />
<br />
Interesting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tytrydsdf</div><div class="date">07-26-2012, 15:38</div></div><div class="posttext">I was botting with about 10 chars. 2 of them are banned. <br />
1st character is 55lvl i dont think so that he used a script that send custom packets in wrong/outdated format. He was walking with normal cavebot without any hex commands.<br />
2nd char is 20lvl druid created 3 days agoe. He used only cavebot scripts with waypoints and setmeelatack and setloot. SO IM SURE he didnt send any wrong packets.<br />
But my 2 knights in shadowthorn and in mintwailin with depositers didnt get ban. im sure they sent many invalid packets (for example opening closed doors or cutting cutted grass or cutting grass with rubbish on the top, and many others.<br />
<br />
Cipsoft usually bann 5~k of botters. But there are much more botters then 5k so not everyone gets ban. It doesn't depend of that what script did u use but of luck couse they dont bann all botters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed the backround light going on and off when removing a piece of equipment or equiping a new piece of equipment and some other occasssion's can't remember exactly....I had updated version of Blackd<br />
<br />
Some of the command's i'v been using:<br />
<br />
<br />
sayInTrade withdraw $numericalexp:{$numericalexp:{$numericalexp:{$_pot s$}-{$countitems:{$_potid$}$}$}*{$_potprice$}$}-{$numericalexp:{$countitems:{$_emptypotid$}$}*5$}$<br />
<br />
fastExiva sell:$_emptypotid$:$countitems:{$_emptypotid$}$<br />
<br />
fastExiva buy:$_potid$:$numericalexp:{$_pots$}-{$countitems:{$_potid$}$}$<br />
<br />
fastExiva check x,y,z<br />
<br />
sayMessage exiva turbo<br />
<br />
I did notice a few Hex command's in a script made by Malmis for venore swamp troll's i used that on a Facc that got deleted....Example:<br />
<br />
<br />
fastExiva &gt; A2 $hex-idofname:Ottokar$ 01 00 00 00</div></div><hr />

Only thing different from my account to yours is that.. ive subscribed to tibia, Via direct debit, So maybe they did'nt wana loose the monthly subscribed customers so they just logged me out ????? <br />

Yeah I think they don't ban many PACC's because they lose money. ;)<br />
<br />
The majority of the 6k that got banned were FACC, i'm pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

I finally am finished with my FACC Escapade and will no longer be using Cave bot but will still be taking full advantage of all the features. Alas, I am here to say again not a single ban in 5 banwaves, 40 Faccs(Fully Blessed) all my own scripts written by hand all approx 3-5 hours of work depending on difficulty of the area but I just have to say guys I used to be there with you, use other peoples scripts. Honest, sit down for a few hours, scour the forums and learn to write all of your own scripts that is the 100% safest way. Stop using EXIVA turbo for one, I guarentee thats why you were banned Vinnie. Second of all, you are sending a bunch of unnessecary packets in my opinion, Instead pre-calculate what 150 mana pots cost for example than use exiva buy :XX XX:N ( exiva buy :0c 01:150 ) and pre calculate what 150 pots cost. Anywho just a few tips of advice, thanks again Daniel for all of the hard work :) You are the man and thank you for the ridiculously quick updates, the free service and all of the help =) You are a genius. <br />

Yes, as far as I know, those actions are performed by the proxy trying to imitiate a human action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but imagine you sent the wrong packets to login... You wouldn't login... And cipsoft would be like &quot;why and how did this account send an impossible packet?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibrahim</div><div class="date">08-19-2012, 00:19</div></div><div class="posttext">and are packets that perform each function in tibia changed on each version update?</div></div><hr />

Buying stuff yes, use Exiva buy :XX XX:N   N = the number you want to buy, XX XX represents item id for pot ex ( 0c 01 ) would look like, Exiva buy :0c 01:150 and you would have to withdraw 7500 gp to buy. Anywho a few tricks Ive figured out along the way :d but as I said I have retired and will probably only run Blackd for heals and training :) Thanks again Daniel for all your hard work!<br />
