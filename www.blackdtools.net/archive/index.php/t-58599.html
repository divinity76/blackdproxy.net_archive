<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sharpie</div><div class="date">08-21-2012, 21:00</div></div><div class="posttext">I use this all the time to loot health potions but NOT put them into the depot when I get back. Heres what I do: <br />
<br />
<br />
setLoot [all loot id's, etc]<br />
[script waypoints]<br />
IfTrue ($mycap$#number&lt;=#10000) Goto $nlineoflabel:droploot$<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
:droploot<br />
resetLoot<br />
[waypoints to walk to your drop point]<br />
setLoot [ALL ID'S OF ITEMS YOU WANT TO DROP] <br />
dropLootOnGround<br />
resetLoot<br />
[waypoints to walk to your beginning again]<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, say you're looting energy rings and gold. You want to drop the rings but keep the gold. It would look something like this:<br />
<br />
#energy ring<br />
setLoot EB 0B<br />
#gold<br />
setLoot D7 0B<br />
[moving through waypoints]<br />
IfTrue ($mycap$#number&lt;=#10000) Goto $nlineoflabel:droploot$<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
:droploot<br />
resetLoot<br />
setLoot EB 0B<br />
[moved to drop zone]<br />
dropLootOnGround<br />
Rings are now on the ground.<br />
resetLoot<br />
[walk to beginning of waypoints]<br />
gotoScriptLine 0<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have issues still, just post your script and let me take a look at it. It shouldn't be too difficult</div></div><hr />
