<br />
I think a professional tatto studio should be able to answer your question.<br />
Still i would ask atleast in 2 stuidos to be sure they did not figure it out.<br />
<br />
About &quot;our&quot; tattos.<br />
I am playing with the thought of getting a tatto of the Lion from the summerjam (a reggae fetival in germany, but know in whole europe)<br />
just dont know where to set it.<br />
I would even set it under my feet, just to know i have it.<br />
