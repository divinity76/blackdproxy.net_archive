Enjoy bud and happy botting :) feel free to browse my entire project where you will see my progress with using those scripts and you may like what you see!<br />
<br />
All scripts there are uploaded and explained where to start from and to carry enough food/supplies to last you however long you plan to bot, it has a depositor but no refiller so you will need to take care your first attempt to see what kind of supplies you need to keep with you!<br />
