<br />
Dear CipSoft GmbH,<br />
<br />
I would like to show my opinion about the deletion of my dear friend, Striker Motta.<br />
<br />
My friend is a fair player, and we talk everyday, he plays the game for long time, enjoy his premium time, quests, and this account is all what he got. He put so many efforts on his account for long time, and this unjustified banishment is unfair! Please check your system, because &quot;Striker Motta&quot; is really not a cheater, and you should take care and remove the deletion from his account!<br />
<br />
Thanks, (your char name) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- IMPORTANT!!!!</div></div><hr />
