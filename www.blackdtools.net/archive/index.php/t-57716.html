If this doesn't work your waypoints must be too far apart. Try doing one at the bottom of the hole and one at the top</div></div><hr />

ok i checked the way poiints. one is at the spot where i wud rope the other is where i appear after the rope. doesn't work :/ shovel works fine tho. so it must be the elevenhair rope which doesn't make alot of sense it worked before... anyone else have issues with an elevenhair rope?</div></div><hr />

I think I read somewhere about problems with it before. Just use a normal rope. You shouldn't be botting main chars anyway and 6cap is nothing</div></div><hr />
