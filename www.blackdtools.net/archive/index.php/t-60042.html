is it dangerous (meaning i can get banned on other acc for just having on computer? or even on the bot account, chances of me getting banned using blackd?)<br />
Idk, Pretty much i want to get friendly with using some type of bot whether its blackd or somthing else... <br />
Any advice/help is appreciated, Thanks in advance to anyone who replies w/o trolling me for being new to botting haha.<br />
Oh, And also, I use a laptop to play, but let me tell ya its not a very good laptop... will the bot slow my computer a lot? I tend to get kicks, but plan on only using bot for simple monsters such as rotworms etc... w.e gets the job done for free $ on the side D:... <br />
And another thing, Im new to being able to play from the site and honestly havent even logged into it, is it the same as having the client downloaded? Like can i bot from entering tibia at tibia.com? or i need the client, because i use client right now but i feel like it slows my computer a lot having it downloaded and running</div></div><hr />

1. BlackD is free.<br />
2. No, you have to learn on your own and read tutorials and posts that are all available here on the forums.<br />
3. It is not dangerous as long as you do not run Cavebot/ Fastexiva &gt; Cmds you know nothing about.<br />
4. If you learn you can write all your own scripts to make some $ on the side.<br />
5. If you use a shitty computer it will probably lag your second client, I am able to run 10 BlackD clients w/ a decent computer.<br />
6. BlackD runs off of the Tibia.exe so yes, you need the downloaded client because BlackD does not attach to the flash-game.<br />
<br />
I hope all these answers helped atleast a bit, I am not trying to be mean but someone cannot just hold your hand and teach you or you will never actually &quot;learn&quot; go try creating your own and compare them to someones on the forum, they dont have to be pretty, just use the more simple commands of blackD for example..<br />
<br />
setLoot xx xx ... ex ... setLoot D7 0B<br />
setMeleeKill xxxxx ... ex ... setMeleeKill rotworm<br />
putLootOnDepot ... ex ... putLootOnDepot       &lt; Very straight forward. add a few waitX 2 in there just to be safe.<br />
<br />
These are just a very few examples of some simple commands, but take a peek around and learn my friend it is all on this forum for you to read.<br />
<br />
