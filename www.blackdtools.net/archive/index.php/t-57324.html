I've been using BlackD Proxy 2 years ago then I went onto Neo and now I'm just semi retired and I was wondering if it is safe to use some functions in the cavebot since it's not recommended to use cavebot at all if you don't want to get caught. 
 
Anyway, here's the case - I want to fish! So I wrote a simple script: 
 
sayMessage exiva fish 
setLootOff 
waitX 0,5 
gotoscriptline 0" />

So, is there any harmful packets being sent to the server using this kind of a script?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">02-24-2012, 15:12</div></div><div class="posttext">@xHellsx ... Yeah, well that fishX command in cavebot doesn't work for me anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it isn't at all needed and could be a dead packet</div></div><hr />

<br />
With BlackD the way it is any option set anywhere can send stupid packets... I remember the &quot;safe stealth window&quot; actually sending impossible messages into the tibia client haha<br />
<br />
Either way the setlootoff seems pointless for a fishing only script</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">02-24-2012, 23:13</div></div><div class="posttext">@xHellsx ... Well, I'm using it because people are walking by killing spiders/wolves and such things and sometimes I kill those as well. With that function in the script, bot doesn't loot monsters and without that function on, character would just run to the creature killed by another player and try to loot it.</div></div><hr />
