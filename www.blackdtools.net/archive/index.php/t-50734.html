My school's computer lab in those times sucked, so ppl could install any program on them, including, of course, tibia - and also keyloggers.<br />
one day one upperclassman was hacked - by a lowerclassman. he threw (or stole) all his items and pked to red skull with his char, but after a while he was caught checking the keyloggers's logs on the PC. you know what happened.. he got ultra bullied, threatened, and in few days everyone knew what was going on and well, he got constantly bullied until their parents and school officilas stepped in.. and they ended the conflict by paying a sum of money to him lol</div></div><hr />

A guy that hacks your account and destroy your character deserves a beating, but now the story is reverse, a innocence guy gets threatend becuse he don't want to give away hes items to some jerks.<br />
<br />
And yes, shit like this can happen anywhere.</div></div><hr />
