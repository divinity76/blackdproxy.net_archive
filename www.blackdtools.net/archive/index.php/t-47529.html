<br />
I have recently joined the Blackd community and this is my first released script, first of many I hope.<br />
<br />
What it does?<br />
This script will take a new character and level it until it has 6200 experience points. It is fully automated and no interaction is needed between the character and the person. <br />
It know takes your character to main and up to level 11!<br />
<br />
How does it do it?<br />
This script will make the character hunt for food to make cash in order to buy decent equipment before starting to hunt. After it reaches the specific amount of golden coins it buys all the equipment and then begins hunting in Al Dee's Sewer cave from level 1 through 4. When it reaches level 4 it then goes hunting on the Northern part of the island since it is faster than hunting rats until level 8.  <br />
<br />
Changes in Version 2<br />
  Although it does not hunt them, I have added trolls in the kill list in order to avoid alarms.<br />
  Added auto-continuer in case you get kicked or logged out. (See instructions for details).<br />
  Removed areas of poison spiders (many characters that were used to test the script died).<br />
  You can now select a vocation, weapon and city and it will take you to main. <br />
  Experience Points needed to go to the Mainland is now 6000 to avoid issues with becoming level 9 and not being able to grab new items in Destiny Island.<br />
  While hunting in the Northern part if the character has less than 90 hitpoints it will go buy food, eat and wait for hitpoints to recover and then resume hunting. (Many testers died when hunting not on peak hours).<br />
  Added Wolf Paws to loot.<br />
  Better, More efficient food hunting (Will notice it has no capacity left sooner).<br />
<br />
<br />
What does it do in Main?<br />
From levels 8-11<br />
  Goes to depot and deposits all money (Except 50 gps).<br />
  If it has 50 golden coins it will go buy a Rope then hunt the Sewers till level 11.<br />
  If it doesn't have that amount it will go hunting in the sewers until it has 50 (it will not get trapped in holes). Once it gets 50 golden coins it will go buy the rope for better hunting.<br />
  If it at any point it has lost more than 120 hitpoints it will go buy food, eat it, wait to recover and continue hunting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What does it kill?<br />
For Money: Pig<br />
 Deer<br />
 Sheep<br />
 Rabbit<br />
<br />
Levels 1-4: Rats<br />
 Cave Rats<br />
<br />
Levels 4-8: Spider<br />
 Poison Spider<br />
 Wolves<br />
 Deer<br />
 Bugs<br />
 Snakes<br />
<br />
Levels 8-11: Spiders<br />
 Poison Spiders<br />
 Bugs<br />
 Rotworms<br />
 Bats<br />
<br />
<br />
What equipment does it buy in rook? Backpack<br />
 Sabre<br />
 Leather Armor<br />
 Leather Legs<br />
 Wooden Shield<br />
 Studded Helmet<br />
Note: Before going to main it grabs the equipment from the quest room in Destiny Island. Feel free to change its equipment as you see fit, but only after it reaches the Mainland.<br />
<br />
Other Comments<br />
<br />
 This script was designed so it can hunt in the area where the pigs and sheep are. Do not worry about it getting trapped with the gates as it will not happen.<br />
 It was decided that the wolves cave will be avoided since while testing it was found that even characters of level 7 or 8 can die when sorrounded by 4-5 wolves. (For people who want to know, the script was set to only hunt the wolf cave if above level 6 but it was too dangerous).<br />
 Some part of the script where taken from Arne's Script (http://blackdtools.net/showthread.php?t=34020), but everthing in the script was tested carefully. Thanks Arne!<br />
 It was noted that although it will get experience faster the character will not loot as many golden coins as other scripts where it just hunts rats but the purpose of this script was to get it to the mainland fast, after all 600 gps are easier to get there.<br />
 After it is done remember to check the bank because if at any time your character makes more than 500 golden coins it will go deposit it at the bank.<br />
 It was decided to make it for free accounts as most people will use this script to level cash-makers.<br />
 Tip: The script was successfully tested while using balanced fighting.<br />

<br />
Where you open the cavebot window from blackd tools, there is a checkbox option that says &quot;Allow reposition at start&quot;. You have to make sure it is not checked (no nike mark on it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
@Tippy88: This issue did not happen to me. In addition as you can see below, the new version will have an auto resumer so it shouldn't happen at all.<br />
<br />
Announcement:<br />
I am currently working on two things.<br />
1. A part at the beginning of the script that will allow you to continue botting if you where kicked or you logged out because of server save with out the need to do anything (just take the character back to temple).<br />
2. A part where you choose a vocation and it goes to Destiny Island, drop all noob equipment, grab the new quest equipment then head to the boat and move to the city of your choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am currently testing the new version of the script that will take the character through the Destiny Island and to the Mainland according to the vocation you choose. (Done for Knights)<br />
<br />
In addition, I thought that I could make a script that takes the character up to level 15-20 automatically (From 1)with depositers and no waste at all, but I am looking for someone to help me. I will do all the scripting but I am looking for someone to guide in me in the areas. To be honest I don't know the FACC areas because I'm premmy. I am looking for someone who will teach me nice areas, not like Ab'Dendriel trolls where the probability of dying is extremely high due to player killers. Also this person would get the scripts before released for thorough testing.<br />
<br />
Anyone interested?</div></div><hr />

Changes are explained in the first post of the thread!<br />

It will now take your characters to main and keep leveling them!<br />

Some people, like me, have characters with equipments in rookgard so the lvling process can be faster. If it is that the case you should add that code line and make the character logout near the oracle.<br />
Oh...and don't forget that blackd now is now set to ignore targets by default if they take more than x seconds, so you need to add SetMaxAttackTimeMs 9999999999999999 to your scrip. Unless there is other solution that i'm not aware of.( My characters were ignoring rabbits, sheeps because it was taking too long.)<br />
<br />
@edit:<br />
2 of my characters were having problems with the &quot;Hunting in North&quot;. Their problem was equipments. After changing the armor and shield for studded they were hunting fine. Could you make the bot hunt a few more rabbits and buy those equipments? It will waste time in getting money, yes, but it will save during the hunts.<br />
<br />
Anyway, great script you made :)</div></div><hr />

At the beginning I want to tell you, that I am completely noobeq in blackD. I had lots of experience with Elfbot but I see that it is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! <br />
<br />
I've got little problem with script. I died. Dunno why, wasnt by computer. But now I can't start! I have got level 5, and when I go to rookgard temple, it doesnt go north (but &quot;cavebot&quot; send me msg that it goes). It goes hunting meat (but do not kill any monsters). I tried to go to north manual but it doesnt start to hunt there anyway. I also tried to remove all waypoints (only move and such like buying eq) on rookgard city and rats. It gave nothing though.</div></div><hr />

Why does it go to the bank twice? Instead of just withdrawing 150g at once.<br />
Second, in my case it failed to buy a sabre, I am not sure as to why but it got all the other eq together. I noticed it was fisting rats, so maybe you oughta check it out.<br />
The third thing is that it's pretty stupid to keep on looting meat/hams and kill deers when it goes north in Rook... It's just a waste of cap and time.<br />

The character I'm trying it on hasn't reached main yet so I can't say how it goes there but I hope it shouldn't have any more problems. :P</div></div><hr />

No, it should go hunt at other areas after lvl 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pliszka</div><div class="date">09-15-2010, 19:02</div></div><div class="posttext">drop loot on ground function requires that the character stands on the x, y, z where the line was created.<br />
<br />
but most non floor reset places is sqms where you can not stand with your character for example this place.<br />
<br />

<br />
so if the lootdroponground would just throw the items that is on setloot and not be required to stand on the sqm while dropping it would be really good cause alot of exping grounds has non floor reset sqms but they are like these ;S</div></div><hr />

Just take your char to the land (out of water).</div></div><hr />

Okey, I will try it, when black will be updated. I hope it will works :)</div></div><hr />

Even if it has some bad things I hope you'll make more and more and better scripts and thanks for all you have already done.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one more thing. As already said REMEMBER TO SET MAX ATTACK TIME TO REALLY BIG NUMBER (i.e. 9999999). That's why it was taking me so long - my char stopped attacking after a while so it collected food once per many animals</div></div><hr />

Yeah, my new version has that maxattack issue fixed, but im still waiting on Blackd to resolve some issues before releasing it. I guess I didn't do the tutorial because it required some sort of counter of the little quest (the kill 3 cockroaches) and it would imply the need for extra conditional events.</div></div><hr />

You could just leave a char there for 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
And btw I have died today using this script. Again. Last time on wolf at 4th lvl and this time on poison spider at 5th.</div></div><hr />

I presume this is because you can no longer hold gold in your hand, it has to go in a bag.</div></div><hr />
