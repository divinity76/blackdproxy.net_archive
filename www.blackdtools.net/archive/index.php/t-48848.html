<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunatyck</div><div class="date">02-26-2010, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">your best bet is to download one from torrentz.. read the comments/description before you download to see if it is working properly or not and I tend to download the most popular one with most seeders..<br />
<br />
<br />
you can search it at torrentz.com<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">02-26-2010, 19:16</div></div><div class="posttext">if non genuine download windows 7 activator and install with your OEM</div></div><hr />

Best way to go.  If you installed a cracked OS we really cant help without us looking at it.  So post pics and give more information or check user comments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I've bought the original version. I've installed it on 3 computers plus a laptop. The laptop I use to work has the original key up and running (as if any fiscalization goes around I don't get to pay for using pirate versions so...) but then I just cracked the others.<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure about how it's named but it's something like Seven Loader or so.<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't try to crack up the seven if you have already updated it through windows updater.</div></div><hr />
