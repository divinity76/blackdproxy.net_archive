Anyways for some time I will keep both versions of Blackd Proxy available for download. You will find 2 versions there: &quot;CLASIC&quot; and &quot;NG&quot;</div></div><hr />

Its a modified Blackd Proxy with some new features and another interface, so it still detectable.<br />

<br />
There is a possible to make a 'safe mode' by including BSC functions, but to do something like will spend much time.<br />

What OT do you play? Probably I forgot to disable this function in the source, I think this is the problem:<br />
<br />
Public Sub CheckIfGM<br />
<br />
If (gotGM = True) Then<br />
            DangerGM(idConnection) = True<br />
<br />
<br />
With time Daniel will fix it</div></div><hr />

You can do it if you have visual basic6.<br />
<br />
Is it just message on screen? I think it wont disable any function</div></div><hr />

In Classic Blackd Proxy you need to set the proxy manually, its very complicated. <br />
<br />
EG with Normal Blackd Proxy<br />
<br />
1.) Open BlackD Proxy.<br />
2.) Open Proxy Section.<br />
2.1.) [Uncheck] Change all Tibia clients memory so they can login to proxy<br />
2.2.) [Uncheck] Change character list packets (use proxy for game connection)<br />
2.3.) [Uncheck] Force login server: ~<br />
3.) Close Proxy section.<br />
4.) Open Tibia client.<br />
5.) Change IP of opened client with an IP changer.<br />
6.) Open Proxy section.<br />
6.1.) [Check] Forward to OT server (shadowcores.twifysoft.net, 7171)<br />
6.2.) [Check] Change all Tibia clients memory so they can login to proxy<br />
6.3.) [Check] Change character list packets (use proxy for game connection)<br />
7.) Close Proxy.<br />
8.) Login.</div></div><hr />

- Fixed a remaining bug that happened when another player gets experience nears you in Tibia 10.55<br />
- I disabled that old &quot;on gm stop&quot; feature. People can optionally reenable it the Config menu, but it is not really usefull feature nowadays so it is better to keep it disabled in most cases.</div></div><hr />
