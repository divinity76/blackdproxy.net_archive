Believe me, there is a loot of cash to be made for the first coder who comes with a safe bot, without any client modifications etc, this could be your chance, build a safe bot and charge us on montly basis as ekx used to do. I'll be glad to be your forum administrator then, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Do you want this person to modify the current source you have available for download? <br />
Which things do you want removed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">12-31-2011, 21:25</div></div><div class="posttext">Blackd said you can change everything you want: add new features, change HUDs, appearance, menus and many others.<br />
After you make all those changes, you just need to mail the edited source and, if he finds it safe, BlackdProxy/others will be updated.<br />
<br />
If you understand enough, you could make a few changes :D (I dont understand anything about VB :p)</div></div><hr />
