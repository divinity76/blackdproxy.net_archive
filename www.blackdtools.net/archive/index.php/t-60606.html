	<meta name="description" content="So... just got 3/3 of my moneymakers banned :( 
 I was even checking him and watching, then boom! The char got teleported from the hunting spot to the temple and in less than one second, logs out with &quot;Your acc has been banned blabla&quot; message.  
 I must admit, this one got me, I thought they were only doing a ban wave each 2 months haha, so I lost some stuff on the moneymakers :( 
 The last wave I had 5/5 banned, now 3/3 T.T 
 So, are you guys getting all the accs banned too, or just some ?" />

<br />
Also for equipment for money makers, if you see my project I had no problem running level 50 knights with the original brass set from island of destiny. The only thing I upgraded was the weapon.<br />
<br />
Since tibia is dead since there is no pvm and no pvp anymore I don't even run money makers anymore</div></div><hr />
