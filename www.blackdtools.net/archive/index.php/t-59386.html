	<meta name="description" content="I am trying to set my cavebot up for training but it doesn't seem to be working for me. All I want my character to do is move one step to the left, wait, and then move one step to the right to keep from being logged out. The trainer doesn't work because the idle warning happens after 10 minutes and not 15. My cavebot works with greater distances but I can't get it to move just one step. Is there an easier way to do this or what might be wrong?

I saw no news of this change.</div></div><hr />

Yasje - As I mentioned in my OP, trainer doesn't work because message comes up after 10 and not 15, I still get kicked every time. XHellsx - I am playing on an OT server, not real Tibia. Sorry I didn't mention that. Training still doesn't work. The only thing I can get to work is a macro recorder which isn't suitable when I'm still trying to use the computer.</div></div><hr />

This will prevent you losing connection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you! I haven't learned full use of exiva yet, so this is perfect.</div></div><hr />
