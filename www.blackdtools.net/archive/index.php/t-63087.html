From today all my Tibia 11 tools are open source and 100% free for everybody! (no need to purchase anything anymore).<br />
<br />
Bad news:<br />
You can expect all known cheat tools to stop working after the incoming big Tibia patch of 21 March 2017 (they will include a very aggresive cheat detection spyware that can read everything in your computer).<br />
<br />
What can you expect after 21 March 2017?<br />
- Nobody will be able to cheat using PUBLIC software. Of course some people might be able to keep doing small cheats using custom private small secret bots.<br />
- Forget about cavebots. After a few reports they will detect what software is causing the movement and then they will blacklist that software.<br />
- If you are an experienced programmer and you like cheating, then you might be able to build a working private bot only for you and maybe for a pair of friends. However it would go blacklisted really fast in case you publish it and/or a lot of people start using it.<br />
- I probably won't waste my time trying to make a working public cheat for official Tibia. I will only keep selling gold and codes.<br />
<br />
Can we bypass that new detection system?<br />
- Impossible is nothing. However it will be EXTREMELY HARD. You should keep in mind that they have a lot of expert people working on it every day and releasing updates to fix any possible way of bypass.<br />
- We should fight a public anticheat system: BattlEye. A lot of programmers of many important games are already thinking a working method, but this is not exactly easy. BattleEye is a strong spyware that can know your running proccess, window titles, installed hardware, installed software and a lot more.<br />
- Possible solution 1: Make a custom Tibia client without BattleEye.<br />
- Possible solution 2: Patch/Inject dll into Tibia client to bypass BattleEye and bypass its detection for BattleEye presence.<br />
- Possible solution 3: Build a special system enviroment where Tibia.exe can run without real system information. Tibia.exe should obtain standard results not containing your cheat process/folder/files. Maybe you can run Tibia.exe inside a virtual machine and you can run cheats outside that virtual machine. If the cheat software running outside is able to read/write memory of Tibia.exe then it can make some undetectable magic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is important to note that CMs said that they won't allow Battleye to ban cheaters; so it looks like another &quot;permanent warning&quot; removal encouraging people to try and cheat still.<br />
<br />
Daniel; I don't know if you'd be up to the task but Medivia is going off in a big way with 4 active servers with 1000+ players on each world. I don't know if you'd want to look at any potential business opportunities there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-16-2017, 22:05</div></div><div class="posttext">- Yes, Players will still see people cheating. Cheat will still happen. But only from very private bots that will remain undetected. All public bots will be blacklisted by that system sooner or later.<br />
- Yes, I know about Medivia. Maybe after I stop supporting Cipsoft Tibia I can start making configs for some interesting ot servers like that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell me 1 game protected by BattlEye thats full of cheaters, and i mean the kind of cheater that persists and not the ones being banned every single day.<br />
BattlEye cant be beaten, thats a fact. No one can cheat on Ark, R6S, Arma III, DayZ and so on</div></div><hr />

If you could program a light hack, fisher, and spear pick up, I'd pay monthly for simple quality of life hacks from you.</div></div><hr />

You can bypass it for a while but they will detect it and you will be banned, ur only safe if ur using a private hack.</div></div><hr />
