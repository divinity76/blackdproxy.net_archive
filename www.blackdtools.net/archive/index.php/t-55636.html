Hi!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've played wow on and off since it's vanilla release in Europe in 2005. Here are the current answers to your questions;<br />
<br />
1. For gold, try www.itemgarden.com they are based in HK and I have bought over 400k gold with them over the years<br />
<br />
For characters try mmo-bay.net<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Bots, well to be honest they are almost all detectable. The WoW client is extremely clever in detecting. I know several people who have used pirox and the other main &quot;bot&quot; program wow glider has been destroyed as blizzard entertainment took the creator to court in a high profile law suit.<br />
<br />
3. Addons - you can literally customise your client anyway you want - it's not illegal, checkout www.curse-gaming.com and browse through the many thousands of ui mods and game addons people have coded.<br />
<br />
4. Gold prices. These fluctuate hugely from server to server and faction to faction. Each server is it's on economy-literally. You can usually check how much gold is being farmed by checking prices on a site such as itemgarden.  But beware, farming gold is not like tibia, prices can and do yoyo, one week 50,000 gold maybe worth $180USD and the week after gold sellers could have a surplus in supply and it could drop to $50.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out. Let me know if you have any more questions.<br />
<br />
Best<br />
