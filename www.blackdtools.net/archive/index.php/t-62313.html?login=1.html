	<meta name="description" content="Hello.  
Nowdays OT servers version 7.4 have became very popular. And because of that the bug fixes that were made in upper versions by cipsoft are not implemented. Of course some owners of OT have got big knowledge what do they have to fix but sometimes they forgot to do that and some another owners dont have clue at all.
