<br />

<br />
How I will do it:<br />
<br />
At this moment I only will give access to the latest installer of Blackd Proxy to persons who bought tibia gold recently at my web:<br />
https://blackdtools.com/tibiagold.php<br />
<br />
Just buy tibia gold worth at least 4 EUR and after that you can request the download link here:<br />
https://blackdtools.com/vip.php<br />
<br />
The access to the download is just a gift for customers, not a license purchase.<br />
The access last 30 days. During that time you can download latest versions. During that time you will also have support as VIP.<br />
 <br />
There is no usage time limit after installation. However, if a big tibia patch happens then might need to download newest version in order to play real Tibia.<br />
<br />
Important warnings:<br />
- You should only use cheats at your very own risk. There is a serious risk of accounts deletion by Cipsoft when using cheats, especially when using cavebot.<br />
- Blackd Proxy for Tibia 11 is in beta stage at this moment. Around 90% of the features should work correctly, however you might miss some of the old features and you might experiece minor bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">10-26-2016, 16:29</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the people who don't like this. However I think it is the most fair system to get a small payment for the huge time invested here.<br />
<br />
First of all: I am very far from being rich so I don't see the point in losing that potential money. If I were rich then of course I would give it for free. That is not the case. And anyways, I am still sharing sources of the very latest versions at GitHub knowing I will lose some potential money because it.<br />
I will do exceptions for moderators who request me it. No problem.<br />
I will do exceptions with real friends. No problem.<br />
I will do exceptions for VB6 programmers. No problem.<br />
For the rest of people... Sorry, but I need the money and I think it is a fair deal. If you want to use Blackd Proxy in Tibia 11+ client then you only need buy some gold and then you will be able to install it and then you can use Blackd Proxy forever until next important patch.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that you still can use Blackd Proxy for Tibia 10.99. 100% free for everybody. No need to cry yet.<br />
Also keep in mind that Blackd Proxy won't die in next patch. You can expect thousands of players to start using Blackd Proxy when everybody understand that this is the only working bot remaining.</div></div><hr />

Windbot and ibot will work on Tibia 11, and.. didnt you say blackd proxy is 100% detectable ? 0o</div></div><hr />

However, my new tool, Cheatlyzer is not detectable at all and I am proud of having the best bot for Tibia 11 at this moment.</div></div><hr />

I released updates right now. Updated versions should work correctly.</div></div><hr />
