<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olzone</div><div class="date">01-27-2010, 10:11</div></div><div class="posttext">resize it, change format to gif  (really a jpeg/jpg but just change the file end .jpg to .gif)</div></div><hr />

Just open it with Photoshop  and use the &quot;save for web&quot; funnction. You can specify multiple qualities. Depending on that, the KB will reduce. This is the optimal solution of quality/KB</div></div><hr />

Okay this seems to be the most effective methode.<br />
It got from 66kb to 35 kb.<br />
<br />
Thanks to you fry.<br />
<br />
the other methode worked as well but not that effective and it looked less good.<br />
<br />
thanks to everyone anyways :)<br />

<br />
I think you don't even need to use the &quot;save for web&quot; option, it's enough to use &quot;save as...&quot;  and you'll be able to do the same, with a shortcut ctrl+shift+s :)</div></div><hr />
