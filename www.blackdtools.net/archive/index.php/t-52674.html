<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">09-25-2010, 00:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the list of full functions here:  http://www.blackdtools.net/bsc.php<br />
It doesn't have mana burner/rune maker/anti idle/food eater.<br />
If you are looking for functions to be afk i recommend you to search for a windows tasker. They can only perform simple tasks, and anti idle, mana burner and eat full can be done without being detected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">udarr</div><div class="date">09-27-2010, 00:59</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible that CIP upgrade their 'antibot system' and in conclusion I could get ban for using BSC ? I'm weak at informatics technology and I dont understand how it's working, how it could be detected by this owning system...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">09-27-2010, 01:22</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there will be much more upgrades on their tool. However BSC and other recent bots could be detected in case Cipsoft release some software to run at your computer, at the same time you run Tibia, to make sure you're not using any kind of cheats. Allow me to say that at this moment Cipsoft detection is only server-side, based on repetitiveness and packets sent by bots super super fast. <br />
World of Warcraft has a system like that and believe me, it gives more problems to Blizzard than its utility. In case they implement it, it would be rather easy to by-pass xD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How possible is that BSC has not detectable Light Hack ? Is is not change client ? <br />
I just want to know that becaous I'm using BSC (only healer) but I'm still worring about using Light Hack (Xray too).<br />
So how does it work ? <br />
<br />
And second question - is it possible in future to create add a function refiling ammo ? It would be great to skill on trains with that.</div></div><hr />
