<br />
To remove all those possibilities:<br />
<br />
 Close Tibia and Blackd Proxy. After re-open them;<br />
 Do not load any settings;<br />
 Make sure you have deleted your currently  HP/Mana conditions from the HDD;<br />
 Now configure only simple and individual healing rules at a time and test them;<br />

<br />
Such as health potion and not life fluid?</div></div><hr />

I have tried all that, and it did work fine for maybe 2 hours but then suddenly blackd started to give the msg again and refused to drink mana potions. I have no idea what is wrong&quot;/<br />
<br />
(And yes im using the right type of potion set.)</div></div><hr />

Send an email to daniel@blackdtools.com and explain him the problems you're experiencing. Do not forget telling him what have you already tried to fix the problem.</div></div><hr />

Got me killed 3 times.. lol. one of them actually crashed blackd all together. i was using pots fast, faster than usual perhaps it overloads the bot and it cuts itself off before it crashes totally?</div></div><hr />
