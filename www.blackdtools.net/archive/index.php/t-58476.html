Each bit can be 0 or 1. If you have that status then the value is 1, else the value is 0<br />
If you don't have any special status then the status bits array would be 0000000000000000<br />
How to check a single bit?<br />
$statusbit:x$<br />
How to check first bit?<br />
$statusbit:1$<br />
How to check second bit?<br />
$statusbit:2$<br />
...<br />
How to check the last bit?<br />
$statusbit:16$<br />
<br />
Now... the meaning of each bit:<br />
<br />
bit 1 = You may not logout during a fight<br />
bit 2 = You are hasted<br />
bit 3 = You are paralysed<br />
bit 4 = You are protected by a magic shield<br />
bit 5 = You are drunk<br />
bit 6 = You are electrified<br />
bit 7 = You are burning<br />
bit 8 = You are poisoned<br />
bit 9 = You are bleeding<br />
bit 10 = You are in protection zone<br />
bit 11 = You may not logout or enter a protection zone<br />
bit 12 = You are strengthened<br />
bit 13 = You are cursed<br />
bit 14 = You are dazzled<br />
bit 15 = You are freezing<br />
bit 16 = You are drowning<br />
<br />
Note: This guide is valid since Tibia 7.73. Older versions only have bits 1-8 and bits have a different meaning there.<br />

Bump. I need to know if Proxy's modification of the client will get me banned if I only use conditions, i.e. anti paralyse.</div></div><hr />

I am not 100% sure, but I think you won't be detected if you only use that part of blackd proxy.<br />
Anyways maybe I will make something similar in BSC in a near future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For an invisible condition<br />
<br />
Your best picking 5 seconds prior to becoming uninvisible. Otherwise because of the randomiser you could be visible for 5-10 seconds which could end up dieing. So just set use utana vid every x seconds (randomised by 5 seconds) to ensure you don't become visible.</div></div><hr />
