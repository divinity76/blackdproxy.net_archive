I remember when the first banwaves started, I got banned using blackd on my pally who had been botting north port hope around lvl 40. <br />
<br />
Since last August, I've moved from my house into a college dorm, and now play Tibia on a laptop. I bought elfbot around then and decided to start leveling that pally again. The problem with my laptop is that my administrator settings are weird, and everytime I load elfbot, i have to copy and paste the hardware fingerprint stuff into the bot, like its the first time i've ever used it.<br />
<br />
For some reason, I've not been banned in the past 7-8 banwaves (don't remember how many there have been). I've been using a script on my pally with a depositer/spear buyer/ no random timers or anything, just regularly botting like I don't care. I've gotten level 40-97 on the char in that time (mostly botting the past 4 months or so), and have logged 100s of hours on the char completely afk.<br />
<br />
Basically my question is, does the hardware fingerprint thing maybe have something to do with them not being able to detect me? Or maybe does it have to do with where i play (my dorm room), using campus wifi.</div></div><hr />

Grodan, I agree.</div></div><hr />

Grodan, I agree.<br />
<br />
I don't think firewalls have anything to do with this, because Tibia already sends loads of packets to cip's servers every second, the firewall won't detect or block it I think, or else CipAntiCheat would really sucks.<br />

I don't have any firewall nor antivirus so I don't believe in your theory</div></div><hr />

Enjoy your bans guys :)<br />
<br />
you don't even deserve to post with dumb remarks like that.  <br />
<br />
quoted from Kvra, &quot;You might say you are a user of bot X and bot Y and bot Z or whatever bot LETTER you use, just as long as you don't go bragging on about how bot X,Y,Z,WTF is better in that and in this and blablabla...&quot;<br />
<br />
You might want to read the entire thing next time you go on a forum spouting, &quot;YOU'LL GONNA GET BANN!!!! :)&quot;  I honestly bet you are one of the people that became a tutor thinking you'll become a GM one day.<br />
<br />
I'll explain why it isn't bannable.<br />
<br />
So what people are stating in every post is something the other bot is doing that might be the reason why they dont get banned as much.  The only one who might get a ban is crap? who said Blackd sucks and he uses elfbot, but because he got banned on blackd and then bought elfbot and he hasnt been banned sense.  But he didnt make a new forum talking about it, he gave his opinion in a forum that was created by someone else that was asking for opinions, so in my eyes, I don't think he should be banned.<br />
<br />
If anything, you should be banned for taking a topic from the original post and trying to change the subject on it, you're also being blatantly making fun of others which it's against forum rules to flame.</div></div><hr />

No I'm not trying to advertise elf or anything, the community on ng forums is retarded so I figured I'd ask here</div></div><hr />
