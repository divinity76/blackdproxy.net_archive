okay, this seems to be a very odd problem im having. never heard or seen this before. 
 
okay here goes, 
ill load a script in cavebot, get myself positioned in the right place and hit run bot. this is where the problems begin. 
 
when attacking monsters, it will attack them all until dead. e.g. surrounded by torts, it kills them all THEN loots them. but it wont just loot them once, it will open the corpse, take the loot, then close the corpse, then open it again, then close it" />

<br />
id think this was normal if i hadnt used blackd before, so i know its a malfunction somewhere. ive tried using different scripts cuz i thought it could have been a dodgy script but no. still does the same. :(<br />
<br />
if someone could help me with this, would be much appreciated.<br />

Cheers :) Nop x</div></div><hr />
