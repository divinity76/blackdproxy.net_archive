<br />
yes, my mc is safe. <br />
As I already stated several times: all my tools are 100% safe with zero reports of ban/deletion ever. That includes multiclient.<br />
<br />
The only exception is the cavebot function of Blackd Proxy, and I am working on fixing it asap.</div></div><hr />

No warning whatsoever before they ban/delete accounts. And there's no time period after which they ban/delete accounts. It's as random as Rebecca Black's Friday. :D<br />
<br />
When you see a news ticker on tibia.com usually looking like this, containing following:<br />
<br />
<br />
1497 Tibia accounts have been detected using unofficial software to play during the last couple of weeks. These accounts have been deleted today.<br />
<br />
Then just log on accounts you've been using/botting since the last ban wave and you'll see if you were banned or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cipsoft execute deletions of detected accounts at random times, but it happens once each month in average.<br />
<br />
You know that your account survived when you see a news about mass ban in tibia.com and you still can login with your account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to the typical mass ban news message ... I think it means the people there got deletion because they was caught cheating between the news date and 2 weeks before that news date.<br />
<br />
So I think it means that if you did not get deletion there then you will not get deletion, unless you start using detectable cheats.</div></div><hr />
