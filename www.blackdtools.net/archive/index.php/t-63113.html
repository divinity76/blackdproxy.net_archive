<br />
As you all know we have 2 days left until the launch of RealOTS. What we've learned from the previous versions of other owners, is that mages have way more benefits than knights &amp; paladins. In order to balance it out, we've changed the following;<br />
<br />
Knights<br />
All weapons above 30 attack have been buffed with 20% attack damage (example: Giant Sword has 55 attack instead of 46).<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
Light bolts have been added to the game. They are 20% stronger than normal bolts &amp; slightly lighter. They can be bought at every NPC that sells paladin ammunition.<br />
Cost: 6 gold per light bolt.<br />
<br />

For some nostalgic feeling<br />
<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
BoneZ</div></div><hr />
