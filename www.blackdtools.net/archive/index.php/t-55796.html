And talking about neo, i thought the same, continue with neo, but it have to be updated too, and have the same challenge, how he is gonna to create a new safe bot?? or maybe he is not honest like Daniel and start banning his clients??? i think that we must w8 till one more ban wave</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing you have no idea what happened in the 9.1 update. There is no way to read memory addresses (or do anything else memory-related) without patching the client.</div></div><hr />

Blackd Proxy has always been the bot that I liked the most. Maybe not the most powerful cheat tool at the end, but i still use it, and will keep using it on OT servers in the future.<br />
Not only do I like Blackd because of the cheat tools - but also for the forum/community - will always be better than NG and others.<br />

darkstar = blackd<br />
<br />
even ekx thinks blacky here is just giving up, and its false that there's no solution.<br />
so their is that neobot is working on 9.1<br />
<br />
i insist i say ya guys ask for a refund of money and buy neobot LOL<br />
 <br />
Who the hell are you? lol... <br />
<br />
First of all, i think i got all botters on this one that bots need to be safe, and if they just came up with a new system and stuffs HE(this EKX) doesn't know if it really works until next wave.. <br />
<br />
Second.. Neobot is overpriced and not worth buying.. rather spend if i would money on gold and just play the game as it should<br />
<br />
Third.. The good old days are gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
From me: Go back to neobot forums.</div></div><hr />

I loved working with you back in 2007 daniel, it was an honor for me to run the official leveling service at that time, i have alot of respect for you and your craft, you kept the bot alive for sooooo long and certainly has been the best of all time(yes i said it) - fuck neobot and fucking everything else, blackd is how you're supposed to be botting.<br />

Sadly tibia was ruined so long ago.<br />

Thanks for the bot you provided, I used it quite a while, it got me hunted a lot, also got me banned twice. Fortunately the bans and hunted chars were all made 100% by your bot, so nothing lost just a crappy del warning (or not) char gained. Haven't used the bot since probably 2008.<br />

&quot;I won't keep updating my tools. Updating everything would be extremely hard now.&quot;<br />
<br />
NEVER EVER AGAIN?<br />
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE BLACKD TO 9.1, EVEN UNSAFE.<br />
IT'S NOT POINTLESS TO UPDATE BLACKD, MANY CUSTOMERS AS ME, USE BLACKD UNSAFELY TO MONEYMAKING BECAUSE:<br />
1: IT HAS THE EASIEST INTERFACE TO MCING<br />
2: IT ALLOWS COMPUTERS TO USE MANY MCs EVEN WITH LAG IT STILL HUNTS<br />
3: IT CAN BE BOUGHT INGAME<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
&quot;And with recent changes in the code Cipsoft will detect 100% bots now&quot;<br />
<br />
CAN ANYONE GIVE MORE INFORMATION<br />
ABOUT WHAT WERE THE RECENT CHANGES IN THE CODE?<br />
ABOUT WHY IS IT LESS SAFE?<br />
ABOUT WHY DOES IT NEED MORE WORK TO UPDATE BLACKD?<br />

if blackd is really over, well, i am sad i couldnt enjoy its power(i had a great idea i wont be able to acomplish) because i started playing back 2 weeks ago, and was in my plans using blackd<br />

yes, maybe it will be still safe for Windows Xp users. At least it should be a bit safer because you won't need to modify Tibia.exe</div></div><hr />

BSC ready. Blackd Proxy will take around 1 week more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shanera</div><div class="date">07-16-2011, 00:02</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree with source code exposing...<br />
<br />
I want to use blackd even unsafe, and I paid for it, not that I care if others who didn't pay use it, but because I want it to last as long as possible, even unsafe. And exposing it's code will make CIP detect it 100%?<br />
And if it's free, I bet many people will start using it as fast as they can, which will make cip make a counter reaction as fast as they can too to detect it or make it unusuable...<br />
<br />
I hope you change this decision, since are in my plans the use of blackd easy interface to mcing and fast hex sending, to realize my project, that was delayed for ages, and just when I came back to try it few weeks ago, will be ruined by this last update happened.<br />
<br />
My project, Which I plan to make at least 1kk with my 2 computers, every day, was to be powered by blackd proxy hex sending/mcing interface and autohotkey's(windows scrpting lenguage) simplicity to typing to log on accounts/killing and manipulating windows, my project then seems that might not work as long, and as well as I expected.<br />
<br />
I bet there must be other users that don't want blackd proxy's code to be released for other reasons, and that you don't stop updating it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case just send me an email and I will extend your license for free.<br />
Anyways it will be free for everybody as soon I finish updating everything there but I have to make some changes in the code.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I prefer to don't share the authentication code, as I might reuse it for other proyects, but I can say that it was a custom function that combined some hardware ids with random numbers and a crc.</div></div><hr />

i know u dont really know how the auto detection thingy works... but are u pretty sure that if i use only hp &amp; mana, i will not get banned? tthanks</div></div><hr />

but it does send packets to the server or it works like other safe bots (pressing hotkeys) ? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm amazed how awesome you can be! I've been your customer for a long time now and it got me cracking up again when I saw that you sucessfuly updated your bot.<br />
<br />
Though, I got a bug report to adress here ... With just one client everything works great, but when I try to connect another client (MC) to the bot it just fails, it tells me to report it to Daniel, you ^^!<br />
<br />
So yeah, I thought you want to know if there are any bugs occuring and this is one which I found. Well it might be just me, I might just be a noob and do everything wrong.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the bot Daniel and if anyone else has this problem or already resolved it, please let me know! :)</div></div><hr />

Thank you everybody for the good words :)<br />
<br />
The mc problem was fixed in 20.7<br />
<br />
About autohealer: in blackd proxy it works by packets. In Blackd Safe Cheats it works by virtual key press.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so u can pretty much say that blackd safe cheats healing system is safer than blackd proxy's ? or blackd proxy sends the exact same packets a human would send ? <br />
<br />
sorry im beign such an ass with all this, but i wanna be kind of safe to start using it on my main :S. Thanks !</div></div><hr />
