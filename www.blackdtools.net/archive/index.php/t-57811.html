I am sorry about it. Adam does not give me any signal of life since a lot of time. I had no choice. 
If you purchased it by paypal recently then we can return you your money. In this case please contact me here: daniel@blackdtools.com Include your paypal email in this case. 
If you payed by gold then we can't help you there because we don't have access to Adam accounts. You can try to contact" />

<br />
I do hope he will return in the future if he can give a good service.<br />

Anyone have an alternative tibia recorder that alows you to keep the files - (not tibiacast)</div></div><hr />

Hope you think about making a cam Daniel</div></div><hr />
