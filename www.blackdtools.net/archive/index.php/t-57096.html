I am sorry about it. It was a great bot and the creator have my full respect because his high level of skill. I am sure he will work in a much bigger proyect now. 
 
I also can't hide that I am happy that we will have some more new people here because this. :) 
I will try to enhance the safety of Blackd Proxy until I am sure that it is 100% safe again.  
Until that I recommend using Blackd Safe Cheats. That small tool survived to every ban wave so far." />
