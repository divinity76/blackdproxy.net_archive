	<meta name="description" content="Hello 
 
I made a script to sorcerer in Ghostland, with all the right spots, the problem is as follows: 
 
After 15 minutes the character does not attack some creatures, when he kills a child in a spot that went back to the previous point instead of advancing to the next. 
 
It also does not work the self-healing and mana recharge. 
 
Only happen to me there, I do not understand the truth." />
