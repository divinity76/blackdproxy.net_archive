<br />
As you had seen, Daniel made a post saying that rather than making a whole new cavebot/cheat with a new way of doing things so its safe, he plans to work on the current BlackdProxy and try to make it safe by fixing the things that he thinks makes people get caught.<br />
<br />
I really don't know which approach is better but I am confident that he is circumspect when taking decisions about a new safe cheat. <br />
<br />
In a nutshell, I guess on the BSC there is no current progress on a cavebot, but he is trying to make the current one safe. (He has already made some changes and some people, including me, are testing to see how safe it is). <br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />
