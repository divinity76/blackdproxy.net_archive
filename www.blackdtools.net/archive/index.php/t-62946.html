	<meta name="description" content="Hello, 
 
is there any way to pick up custom items from deposit box? And same goes for leaving custom items in deposit box. 
For instance: let's assume that I have a couple of druids that run through food dropping monsters and I would like them to make avalanches for me. 
I would like them to drop any bear paws/wolf paws/iron ores/white mushroom that the characters loot, as well as any created avalanche runes and pick up a custom number of blank runes. 
 
Is it possible? Can I get any advice as" />
