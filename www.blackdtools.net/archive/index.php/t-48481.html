<br />
I've been programming in VB.NET and ASM for over 5 years, and now I'm trying to recruit serious programmers who would like to be involved.<br />
 I don't really want to give out ANY details at all about it, but if &quot;New Idea&quot; and &quot;Project&quot; seem interesting to you, please send me a message with you're MSN, email, or AIM. This will most likely involve some TibiaAPI and some non-TibiaAPI.</div></div><hr />
