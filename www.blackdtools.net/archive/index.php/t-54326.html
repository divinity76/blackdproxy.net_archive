 <br />
Um, didn't use the cavebot and got banned?  I doubt you got banned from having blackd then.  Unless you were spamming autoheal for pk'ing or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seriusly doubt you got banned for just having a bot installed. if so they would ban shitloads of more botters every month. Myself iv had blackd and blackdsafe cheats installed for like 2 years and was banned one of the first mass bans only.</div></div><hr />
