I hope you enjoy this script, it will bring a character to level 8 way faster than my non premium script. 
 
What it does? 
This script will take a new character and level it until it has 600 experience points. It is fully automated and no interaction is needed between the character and the person.  
 
How does it do it? 
This script will make the character hunt for food to make cash in order to buy decent equipment before starting to hunt. This is done in the FACC side. 
After it" />

I hope you enjoy this script, it will bring a character to level 8 way faster than my non premium script.<br />
<br />
What it does?<br />
This script will take a new character and level it until it has 600 experience points. It is fully automated and no interaction is needed between the character and the person. <br />
<br />
How does it do it?<br />
This script will make the character hunt for food to make cash in order to buy decent equipment before starting to hunt. This is done in the FACC side.<br />
After it reaches the specific amount of golden coins it buys all the equipment and then begins hunting in the sewer cave from level 1 through 4. When it reaches level 4 it then goes hunting on the Western part of the island since it is faster than hunting rats until level 8.  <br />
It also has an auto-continuer in case you get kicked or logged out. (See instructions for details).<br />
<br />
What does it kill?<br />
For Money: Pig<br />
 Deer<br />
 Sheep<br />
 Rabbit<br />
<br />
Levels 1-4: Rats<br />
 Cave Rats<br />
<br />
Levels 4-8: Spider<br />
 Poison Spider<br />
 Wolves<br />
 Deer<br />
 Bugs<br />
 Snakes<br />
<br />
<br />
What equipment does it buy in rook? Backpack<br />
 Sabre<br />
 Leather Armor<br />
 Leather Legs<br />
 Wooden Shield<br />
 Studded Helmet<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Comments<br />
<br />
 This script was designed so it can hunt in the area where the pigs and sheep are. Do not worry about it getting trapped with the gates as it will not happen.<br />
 It was decided that the wolves cave will be avoided since while testing it was found that even characters of level 7 or 8 can die when sorrounded by 3-5 wolves. <br />
 Some part of the script where taken from Arne's Script (http://blackdtools.net/showthread.php?t=34020), but everthing in the script was tested carefully. Thanks Arne!<br />
 It was noted that although it will get experience faster the character will not loot as many golden coins as other scripts where it just hunts rats but the purpose of this script was to get it to the mainland fast, after all 600 gps are easier to get there.<br />
 Tip: The script was successfully tested while using balanced fighting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Instructions<br />
1. Create a new character.<br />
2. Login in Tibia.<br />
3. Start script.<br />
Note:Do touch anything else; it will do everything for you. Just make sure Blackd is running actively in the client.<br />
Remember: Uncheck allow reposition at start.<br />
<br />
Instructions for Re-running the Script<br />
This are instructions for when you need to re-run the script on a character that for some reason stopped in the middle of the script running (kick, etc.)<br />
1. Open Tibia and Log in.<br />
2. Bring your character  to the temple.<br />
3. Start the script.<br />
Warning: Do not open the bag/backpack.<br />
<br />
Feedback<br />
All feedback is welcomed, including way to make it better.<br />
It has been tested with many characters and is still under testing (although there shouldn't be any errors). If any errors, they will be fixed as soon as reported.<br />
