As you are all probably aware of, Tibia's privacy policy is changing in April. It allows them to do alot of spying. If you're concerned about this, take a look at sandboxie at:  
http://www.sandboxie.com 
I think this may actually work i would like everyones opinion and if Daniel could tell me if this could actually work would be nice.

<br />
Benefits of the Isolated Sandbox<br />
<br />
Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially. <br />
Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. <br />
Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. <br />
Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.</div></div><hr />

Nah just tested it you can choose wat programs to put on the sandbox.<br />
<br />
so you can only put tibia on it and it will be fine.<br />
<br />
Nowdays everyone has atleast 512MB of ram so i think it will be fine...</div></div><hr />

You are supposed to put the Bots inside the sandboxie not tibia :D<br />
<br />
dunno if it would work with the  tibia instead of bots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zmulan</div><div class="date">04-03-2009, 21:28</div></div><div class="posttext">the program itself is made to &quot;isolate&quot; a program from other parts of the computer.<br />
For example, if you run a trojan while putting it in the &quot;sandbox&quot; it can't spread to any other programs on the computer, so it would probably work for tibia too, but then I'm not sure if Tibia itself would save/read maps, hotkeys etc?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As is written on the main page, it protects spyware from spreading and infecting your computer. However, it won't prevent the spyware from collecting information of your computer and sending it out when ran, because most program do things of the sort anyway and there is no way to universally differentiate it.<br />
<br />
Tibia is not going to infect your computer with spyware so it would be pointless to run it in there. It will just gather data of your computer at runtime, like any other program would, and send it out as game packets. The only way to stop it would be to hack the spyware out of the client specifically, or rather make it send fake results so that they don't notice it was hacked off</div></div><hr />

<br />
where exactly do you find the addional dll on the website, and exactly how do you not allow Tibia to read/write from the particular directories (which specific directories) and how do I restrict access all using the settings.  <br />
<br />
It's not that I don't know anything about sandbox but I kind of would like to know the exact procedure others are taking so I know I'm doing it right./</div></div><hr />
