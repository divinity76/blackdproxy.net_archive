i get this when i try to open a 2nd tibia game window. 
the first window works fine. 
i have been running first window 20min before i tried to open 2nd. 
No other tibia client is running.(checked task manager to be sure) 
 
   I recently did a full reinstall and this is the first time sense that i attempted to use more then one game window. 
 
Was thinking that maybe there is some setting that is new or was preset in other versions." />

Please ensure it maches your tibia version.</div></div><hr />
