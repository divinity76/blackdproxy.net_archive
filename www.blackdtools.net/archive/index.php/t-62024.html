	<meta name="description" content="Hello everyone, I was using windbot but used blackd safe cheats in past only to heal. I'm seeing many ppl getting deleted by using only healer or just a simple anti-idle when using wind/xenobot. 
 
I'm thinking on start using this blackd safe cheats to heal only again. Anyone knows of someone who got deleted yet by using only this? 
 
Thanks!" />

Thanks for the info. The only problem I have by playing manually only healing with blackd is that I get bored too easy when hunting!</div></div><hr />
