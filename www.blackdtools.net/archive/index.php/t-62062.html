<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">06-13-2015, 02:42</div></div><div class="posttext">The bot is detectable. The amount of effort required to fix this (for BlackD Proxy), is unknown and probably immense.  For instance, tibia client is now occationally sending info about the window size to the server (i've read on.. either tprogramming or xenobot forums, i think DarkStaR found it). blackd proxy does not fake this number. And the cavebot can shoot runes on creatures right outside of your vision (its in the tibia memory, but not part of the visible screen), which is detectable. Honestly, if you want to bot these days, i would suggest buying Xenobot by DarkStaR. He really did his homework when it comes to detectability, built from the ground up with detectability in mind, in contrast to BlackD Proxy, which didn't care about detectability for years, and the codebase got huge, and.... god knows where we might be making a detectable mistake nowadays, with all this pre-autodetect code (thousands of lines... 50,000+) still running...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">06-13-2015, 21:55</div></div><div class="posttext">Xenobot is also highly detectable - after recent banwaves I had to check their forums and alot of people complaining of deletions from use of Xenobot only.<br />
<br />
So best not to bot with main accounts at the moment.</div></div><hr />
