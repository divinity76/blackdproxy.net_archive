	<meta name="description" content="Hello guys, and sorry for bothering you all. 
 
Im new on these thing of botting, and my friends told me that BlackD its one of best bots outthere. 
 
So I wanna make a couple questions before buying it. 
Did i'll have to buy the license for 1computer 1 month first, and after that, buy the 1year version?  
 
Im trainning a knight, so i wanted to know if i can train them with the bot for like 24hours or more? 
I'll buy it by DAOPAY, i wanna know if it got support for Brazil, thats where i live" />

But besides that normal issue you can train all you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah thats why I said that there was basically no feature cause I think its deactivated but I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crille</div><div class="date">02-18-2011, 15:45</div></div><div class="posttext">It's actually quite simple to make an auto reconnecter using mouseclicks and keystrokes only (I made a program that logs you in automatically by using forementioned methods, source here (http://tpforums.org/forum/thread-8313.html)). To make it smarter it could also check if the world is online by checking tibia.com to prevent multiple connection attempts</div></div><hr />

Yeah but there is a limit. Dno when it would kick in tbh. Wish we could just turn it OFF. <br />
<br />
NEW FEATURES NEED AN OFF BUTTON :(</div></div><hr />
