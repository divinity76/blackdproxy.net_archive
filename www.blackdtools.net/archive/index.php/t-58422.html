	<meta name="description" content="I was wondering if it would be possible to add to BSC. It is perfect to heal but when you hunt creatures that paralyzes you then sometimes you have full hp and keep walking when paralyzed which is bad ^^ 
I thought about adding an option to use X spell if paralyzed, like haste or something so it doesn't mess with the healings. 
Of course if it would remain undetectable and awesome as it is now. 
 
Thanks in advance." />
