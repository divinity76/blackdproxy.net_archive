I'm trying to get blackD magebomb to use X,Y,Z targeting on players instead of battlelist. 
 
I noticed in the source code that there are other types of attackmodes that isin't in the list, such as

Is there any simple solution for this? Make it use the exiva" />

I'm trying to get blackD magebomb to use X,Y,Z targeting on players instead of battlelist.<br />
<br />
I noticed in the source code that there are other types of attackmodes that isin't in the list, such as<br />
<br />
<br />
Case &quot;type 0 : SD (XYZ)&quot;<br />
    strMode = &quot;0&quot;<br />
<br />
But I don't think it works because when I set type 0 : SD (XYZ) as attack mode, the magebomb won't launch and telling me the target is not in my track. It login just fine if I use the regular battlelist targeting.<br />
<br />
Is there any simple solution for this? Make it use the exiva 0TARGETNAME or something (sd on target function) that already exist.<br />
<br />
Would love to hear from you Daniel or some other programmer.<br />
<br />

<br />
What serv version are you trying to use it on? One that has disabled the above atk types?</div></div><hr />

With custom server types it is amazing anything works. But I guess you could try E-mailing Daniel and if you purchase some gold maybe he will give you some VIP support</div></div><hr />
