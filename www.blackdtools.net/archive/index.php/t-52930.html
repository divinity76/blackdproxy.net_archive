<br />
But that shouldn't stop you training with other people/summons - Find a training guild I'm sure there will be two at war on your server. If not try and organise two &quot;war&quot; guilds yourself to train.<br />
<br />
If not you can buy some better equipment (mostly shield) and try slimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">10-24-2010, 14:50</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, on non-pvp it is hard to get into training guilds - also it can allow you to afk/bot alot easier because noob PKs cannot get to trainers. Means you don't need friends or MC.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Dno, I don't see why that would be the case since if they die they still lose skills/exp<br />
<br />
I don't care enough about optional pvp to look for the answer haha</div></div><hr />
