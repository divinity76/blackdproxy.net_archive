I apologize for the late reply, I had no internet connection yesterday due to a storm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">09-27-2011, 22:19</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand why blackd proxy would try to find tibia.dat in windows/system32 . That is really strange.<br />
Maybe you installed blackd proxy in temp folder or there is a big mess with your Windows.<br />
Solution:<br />
1. uninstall it.<br />
2. download latest installer<br />
3. run installer as admin. Ensure you install it in default folder (something like C:\program files\blackd tools\blackd proxy)<br />
4. run blackdproxy and tibia. If it doesnt work then close both and run both as admin. If it doesnt work (and if you have windows vista or windows 7) then go to your windows control panel / user accounts , select your account and somewhere there select that you want the minimum level of security. Then restart computer and reinstall blackd proxy again. It should work now, no doubt. Test it. After that you can go back to <br />
control panel / user accounts and restore your previous security level.</div></div><hr />

It seems the installer for version 20.8 (which i downloaded a few days ago) didn't work correctly.<br />
After installing it with the new installer for version 20.9 it had a few more files (and ones who were there before had different file sizes) and didn't give the message anymore.<br />
Still do not know what went wrong with the installer but it seems the error was due to the missing files. Whatever the cause was, it no longer happens with the new version.</div></div><hr />
