Maybe someone else may know?</div></div><hr />

Maybe the news is a simple generic text and there was no bug at all. Probably a simple DDoS attack.</div></div><hr />

I've found 2 possibilities ... 1.) Someone said people got their hands on 'free' rares, but that's rather unlikely ... and 2.) Community Manager responded it had to do something with party hunting, which is clearly correct, if it was stated by CM.<br />
<br />
I wonder what it was and if it was SO SEVERE that they had to take every server offline and even reset some of them to the yesterday's server save.<br />
<br />
Could be shitloads of EXP while party hunting ^___^. Woohoo!</div></div><hr />

Name of the CM? What forum/thread? Please tell the link because there are a lot of people curious about it. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it was something about party hunts. That is all the information they can share. Why? ... Maybe they are afraid that the bug is not fully fixed yet? Who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, thank you for sharing that info. If that was the only bug happening then I don't understand why they had to reset half worlds. It only was a small experience bonus, right?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Bonus Experience<br />
Since the Christmas Update 2008, party members in a party using shared experience will get 5% extra experience points from monsters that gives 20 exp or more. If the gained experience is not an integer it will be rounded up to the nearest integer. <br />
Example: Demons will normally give 6000 experience points divided equally among the party members. If you're using shared experience it will be 6300 experience points divided equally among the party members. In a party with 8 members that will be 787.5 experience points each. Since you can't get 0.5 it will round up to 788 experience each. <br />
Note: This will only work if shared experience is activated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps the percentage had been set wrong because it didnt seemed like much more than a 5% bonus</div></div><hr />
