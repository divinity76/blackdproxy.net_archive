I am fairly new to Blackd proxy. Blackd was working, but then i restarded my PC and tibia.exe was missing from the blackd tools folder. I reinstalled it, but when i start it again the blackd wont work with the client. It sees my character but when i add a cord in the cavebot i get 0.0.X as a cord. It does not load conditioanls or use the autohealing. I dont get the message welcome to blackd when i start tibia either.

I am fairly new to Blackd proxy. Blackd was working, but then i restarded my PC and tibia.exe was missing from the blackd tools folder. I reinstalled it, but when i start it again the blackd wont work with the client. It sees my character but when i add a cord in the cavebot i get 0.0.X as a cord. It does not load conditioanls or use the autohealing. I dont get the message welcome to blackd when i start tibia either.<br />
<br />
I play on a OT that is 9.7 and i use the standard tibia client downloaded from the tibia.com site.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have a clue on how to fix this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bug is killing me. I have reistalled Blackd and tibia multiple times<br />
<br />
its like blackd cant fully inject into the tibia, it sees the char but cant do anything with it. When i use exiva addmove in the client it says that character is not logged in. And as said when i add cordinates on the blackd proxy cient it gives me 0,0,7.<br />
<br />
I realy need/want this problem fixed.<br />
<br />
thanks in advanced</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">11-20-2012, 10:55</div></div><div class="posttext">that happens because your antivirus deleted the file without asking you.<br />
<br />
solution:<br />
- uninstall your good-for-nothing antivirus<br />
- install Microsoft Security Essentials.</div></div><hr />
