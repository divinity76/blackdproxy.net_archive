	<meta name="description" content="Hello. 
I would show You one method how you can buy premium account or cc in tibia (and not only). 
Well I personally don't think about spending cash for games (tibia or others). I have found the way. 
OK. what I mean is that you can spend some min per day and play game which is called goldentowns. 
The main thing in this game is upgrading your small village to big big city which makes profit. 
at beginning you may think that it looks boring but when you go deeper you will see it's amazing" />
