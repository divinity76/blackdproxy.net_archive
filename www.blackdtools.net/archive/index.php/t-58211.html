I think that it was caused because he used the old version. Latest Blackd Proxy version already uses high timer/move randomization on that autodance so it should be safer. But I still won't guarantee 100% safety there for now.<br />
<br />
If anyone else got deleted today please post about it!</div></div><hr />

Not sure if this helps either as it seems like you have it figured out.</div></div><hr />

No doubt then. That script was the reason of your deletion in that case. I guess it was sending packet with outdated format or maybe wrong bytes. It would be nice if you can post that script.</div></div><hr />

I think the reason is and old script thad I downloaded 3 days ago that I was intended to edit in order to work acording to what I need but in 3 days I didn't edit anything so I'm almost 100% sure that the reason of my deleted acc was that old script.<br />
<br />
This way I learn the importance of using new scripts or code by my own<br />
<br />
In that acc were 3 knights, lvl 67, lvl 60 and lvl 57</div></div><hr />

Thank you for your report.<br />
Yes, I agree with that: there is always less risk of detection if you use new scripts/self made scripts.</div></div><hr />

What is necesary for a &quot;safe script&quot;??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurriel</div><div class="date">06-06-2012, 16:58</div></div><div class="posttext">To me the solution is quiet simple: Add more buttons with actions in Blackd's Cavebot instead of strings.<br />
If the problem is outdated information, create an option that only accepts values and, when you click enter, it pastes the function  in the script, with the desired action/item, updated for the new tibia version. At each Tibia update, only the program intern values need to be changed and not the scripts.<br />
<br />
So I can be understood, because it was hard for me to explain, here's an example:<br />
<br />
At the moment, to open a chest, we use this:<br />
fastExiva &gt; 82 21 7D 16 7E 08 4D 1E 01 01<br />
<br />
But why dont we use an option like:<br />
: openchest : (either coordinates or other thing like)<br />
<br />
Not sure if I'm seeing this in the wrong perspective, but it seems to be possible and easy to make.</div></div><hr />

A total of 35+ Accounts botted, 0 Banned. I have the sheet in front of me in pencil and not a single one scratched out and all blessed. Life is good. All of my scripts were hand made. and I am watching my computer 99.9% of the time so even when chatted to there is usually a reply to not look AFK. My friend also is botting at the moment, a little less widespread as my net but he has not had a single banned either maybe 10 accounts and I taught him how to script so all his were hand written and simple. Seems to be the key for me and my friend so far. Simple and easy, do not bot your mains and just send all profits forwards. Good luck Blackd community!</div></div><hr />
