	<meta name="description" content="I have been away from tibia for about a year or so. 
 I used to play with tibiabot and elfbot. I have been looking around, and as it seems there are only two bots up and running. Blackd and TibiaAuto.  
 
Is the Tibiabot site down or are just my internet being a bitch?  
 
i have been trying to get NeoBot and Ghostbot too. but it just seems they wont work. 
 
Annyone know what has been happening? In just a year 4 Different bots have gone down?  
 
Would be great to know what has been happening" />
