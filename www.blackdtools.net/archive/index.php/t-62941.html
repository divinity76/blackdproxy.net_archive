I am looking for floor spy, (look at floors below and above you) I know it used to be possible with blackd many years ago but I cant find it now. I want to use it on live servers, so currently 10.96.  
 
I know it will probably get me banned/deleted in a few days but that's not the issue. Thanks for any reply." />

exiva view -X<br />
<br />
They should work, I think.<br />
<br />
You can also bind it to some key on blackd's hotkey menu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
xray does exactly what I was looking for though. I don't think there is any difference between view and xray?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />
