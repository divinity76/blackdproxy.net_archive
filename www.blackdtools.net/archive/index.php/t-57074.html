<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 15:58</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you can do that with conditional events ... For an example:<br />
<br />
This one will eat food - more precisely - it will eat brown mushroom from the first slot from the first opened container, when your mana is less than 100.<br />
<br />
<br />
$mymana$<br />
#number&lt;#<br />
100<br />
300<br />
0<br />
0<br />
exiva &gt; 82 FF FF 40 00 00 8D 0E 00 00<br />
<br />
<br />
These highlighted numbers are food ID, number of opened container and number of slot in which food is located, so you can change those to whatever food, number of backpack or number of slot you want, just look up for item/food ID and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
Side note: In this case shown above I took 'brown mushroom' ID from an OT, I'm not sure if it is exactly the same in real tibia so you might wanna check if the ID is correct if you'll be using bronw mushrooms.<br />
<br />
I presume you're a newcomer, well if it's not understandable, then I'll consider writing a detailed tutorial on how to record packets and wisely use them as conditional events.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you got questions, feel free to ask them, I'll try my best to help you.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Look under 'BlackD Tutorials' on forum ... Guys explained some serious stuff very well.</div></div><hr />
