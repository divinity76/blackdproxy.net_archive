It just sends a packet to BlackD Proxy so it knows what sqm/tile you're standing on.<br />
<br />
I've been using it since I've started using BlackD Proxy about 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
You go around the spawn, set few 'exiva addmove', save it as .txt and later edit the setMeleeKill/SeLoot list and any other functions. It goes pretty fast indeed.<br />
<br />
But back to 'safeness'. I wouldn't use any bot on my main 'main' account. Every bot is detectable and keep in mind that they can pick you out the crowd at any time. Just use it for moneymaking or newb accounts you don't care about that much.</div></div><hr />
