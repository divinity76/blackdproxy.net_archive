It is because, for example, a mage needs at least 3 healings all the time, other vocation could make use of them too. 
I hope its not much work for you. 
 
There are more proposals throughout the forums, I wont bring them all here :) I think that these mentioned here are one of the most wanted and needed. 
 
Kind regards, Ravhul." />
