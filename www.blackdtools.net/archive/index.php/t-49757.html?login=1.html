	<meta name="description" content="Well, I've not been active on these forums for quite a long time, I guess it's because I've stopped playing tibia and sold all I had like 1,5 year ago,  
but I guess still lots of people remember me because of my gold selling shop I had here where I sold like way over 30kk on lots of different worlds. 
 
Anyway, I didn't want to write about tibia, because I no longer know much about it. 
What I wanted to write about is a card game called poker. 
I noticed the game is getting more and more" />
