<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hans Henrik</div><div class="date">03-07-2018, 20:50</div></div><div class="posttext">i've had more success porting the tibia client to the custom client's login protocol, its usually just minor changes to the login protocol, and, if &gt;=7.7, a new RSA/Xtea key<br />
<br />
and to port the login protocol, i used a packet filter, which you can find here https://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?61975-Easily-change-packet-structure-in-source-(Fix-for-some-OT-servers)&amp;highlight=HHBFilter</div></div><hr />
