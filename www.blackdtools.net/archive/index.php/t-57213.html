Hey Hans! I'm doing some sort of a 'rookie' project under screenshot section and I hunt cave rats as well, so was thinking, is there any chance to not eat a specific food? For an example cookies which cave rats drop, I want bot to eat cheese rats drop, but I do not want cookies to be eaten. Or maybe this could be done with conditional events? No idea how would I do that. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
So there isn't a option in the cavebot to make it eat?</div></div><hr />

tileID_lastFoodTileID=17 0E<br />
to be below the (uint16_t) value of cookies, cookies will not be eaten. but that may stop other foods from being eaten as well...<br />
currently, there is no good way to blacklist certain food in blackd proxy :(<br />
Donjuan: Yes there is. as said in my previous post.<br />
setBot AutoEatFood=1</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the stupidity, I have used this bot before but I have forgotten how it works.<br />
<br />
One of the scripts I had from the old days, that I use, is al dee rats in rook, which eat food when open corpse.<br />
<br />
I went through the whole script, and there is just setfriendly, set loot item and kill and move, nothing that describes to eat food as I can see.<br />
<br />
<br />
U mean I must add this; &quot;setBot AutoEatFood=1&quot; at the top or the end or the middle of a script?? .. to make the bot eat food?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I have blackdproxy installed &amp; safe cheats on this computer. I am scared of being deleted, so I have made a couple of new accounts that I bot on with cavebot.<br />
<br />
If I login with another character of my main account, without use cavebot, just login and be online manually OR open 1 tibia client before I run blackd, so I doesn't have to run tibia through blackd... will this account be considered as a botter and will tibia delete that account just because I logged into this computer that has a bot installed?<br />
<br />
Whats ur opinion and if u have heard anything about it, please let me know.</div></div><hr />

you only might get delete in chars that used cavebot.<br />
you should not get delete in the rest of chars, unless a gm manually decide to ban all chars sharing that ip (but there are very low chances of that)</div></div><hr />
