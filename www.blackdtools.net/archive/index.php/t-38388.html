<br />
NG bot: Hello, your community have been making alot of fun about how stupid we are, now I think its time for us! to have fun and laugh about your community.<br />
BlackD: (hmm.. I wanna stay friends with them) Well alright then..<br />
BlackD went to the desert to build a bridge in the desert.<br />
NG bot: The whole community of NG bot went laughing and such..<br />
After 1 year NG bot visitted BlackD again.<br />
NG bot: Well, it's enough now.. you can remove the bridge.<br />
BlackD: I can not.<br />
NG bot: Why?<br />
BlackD: There are 3 people from ur community fishing there, using BlackD's desert bridge fishing script which is released on your forums.<br />

<br />
When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who congratulated him and sent him on his way with a big gift envelope.<br />
<br />
At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars.<br />
<br />
The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures.<br />
<br />
At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee.<br />
<br />
She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door, and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced.<br />
<br />
When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast, eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh squeezed orange juice.<br />
<br />
When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee.<br />
<br />
As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup's bottom edge. &quot;All this was just too wonderful for words,&quot; he said, &quot;but what's the dollar for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said, &quot;Fuck him, give him a dollar.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lady then said, &quot;The breakfast was my idea.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair, while tying the girl to the bed he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife:<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, this guy's an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck.&quot; If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
To which his wife responds: &quot;He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you too!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

anything about sex. Can you explain it to me first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, Sweetheart. Putting it simply, we will call your private place 'the<br />
prison' and call my private thing 'the prisoner'. So what we do is: put the<br />
prisoner in the prison.<br />
<br />
And then they made love for the first time.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, the guy is lying face up on the bed, smiling with satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Nudging him, his bride giggles, &quot;Honey the prisoner seems to have escaped.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning on his side, he smiles. &quot;Then we will have to re-imprison him.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the second time they spent, the guy reaches for his cigarettes but<br />
the girl, thoroughly enjoying the new experience of making love, gives him<br />
a suggestive smile, &quot;Honey, the prisoner is out again!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man rises to the occasion, but with the unsteady legs of a recently<br />
born foal.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, he lays back on the bed, totally exhausted.<br />
<br />
She nudges him and says, &quot;Honey, the prisoner escaped again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Limply turning his head, He YELLS at her, &quot;Hey, its not a life sentence,<br />
OKAY!</div></div><hr />

The person in charge of contributions called him to persuade him to contribute.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our research shows that out of a yearly income of at least $500,000, you give not a penny to charity. Wouldn't you like to give back to the community in some way?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lawyer mulled this over for a moment and replied, &quot;First, did your research also show that my mother is dying after a long illness, and has medical bills that are several times her annual income?&quot;<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, the United Way rep mumbled, &quot;Um ... no.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lawyer interrupts, &quot;or that my brother, a disabled veteran, is blind and confined to a wheelchair?&quot;<br />
<br />
The stricken United Way rep began to stammer out an apology, but was interrupted again.<br />
<br />
&quot;or that my sister's husband died in a traffic accident,&quot; the lawyer's voice rising in indignation, &quot;leaving her penniless with three children?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The humiliated United Way rep, completely beaten, said simply, &quot;I had no idea...&quot;<br />

She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?&quot;<br />
The blonde said, &quot;How about 50 dollars?&quot; The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, &quot;Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?&quot;<br />
The man replied, &quot;She should. She was standing on the porch.&quot;<br />
<br />
A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.<br />
&quot;You're finished already?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; the blonde answered, &quot;and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats. &quot;Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50. &quot;And by the way,&quot; the blonde added, &quot;that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari.&quot;</div></div><hr />

When she asked how her grandfather had died, her grandmother replied, &quot;He had a heart attack while we were making love on Sunday morning.&quot;<br />

Horrified, Katie told her grandmother that 2 people nearly 100 years old having sex would surely be asking for trouble.<br />

&quot;Oh no, my dear, &quot; replied granny. &quot;Many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured out the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring. It was just the right rhythm. Nice and slow and even. Nothing too strenuous, simply in on the Ding and out on the Dong.&quot;<br />

<br />
On their wedding night, she told her new husband, &quot;Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; said the puzzled groom.<br />
<br />
&quot;How can that be if you've been married ten times?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Husband #1 was a sales representative: he kept telling me how great it was going to be.<br />
<br />
Husband #2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.<br />
<br />
Husband #3 was from field services: he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.<br />
<br />
Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.<br />
<br />
Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.<br />
<br />
Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.<br />
<br />
Husband #7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.<br />
<br />
Husband #8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it.<br />
<br />
Husband #9 was a gynecologist: all he did was look at it.<br />
<br />
Husband #10 was a stamp collector: all he ever did was... God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; said the new husband, &quot;but, why?&quot;<br />

&quot;You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed!&quot;</div></div><hr />

One day the teacher called on her while she was napping, &#8220;Tell me Janice, who created the universe?&#8221; When Janice didn&#8217;t stir, little Johnny, a boy seated in the chair behind her, took a pin and jabbed her in the rear.<br />
<br />
&#8220;God Almighty!&#8221; shouted Janice and the teacher said, &#8220;Very good&#8221; and Janice fell back asleep.<br />
<br />
A while later the teacher asked Janice, &#8220;Who is our Lord and Saviour.&#8221; But, Janice didn&#8217;t even stir from her slumber. Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Jesus Christ!&#8221; shouted Janice and the teacher said, &#8220;Very good,&#8221; and Janice fell back asleep.<br />
<br />
Then the teacher asked Janice a third question. &#8220;What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?&#8221; and again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.<br />
<br />
This time Janice jumped up and shouted, &#8220;If you stick me with that thing one more time, I&#8217;ll break it in half and stick it up your ass!&#8221;<br />

&#8230; the teacher fainted!<br />

<br />
One day a hippie gets a ride on a public bus and sees a hot young nun. He sits down next to her and promptly asks if she would like to have sex, to which she immediately says no and walks off the bus. The bus driver leans over and says &#8220;Hey guy I know how to get that nun to have sex with you&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
Naturally the hippie asks, and the bus driver tells him that every night at midnight the nun goes to an old graveyard to pray for god to forgive her for her past, and that he should dress up like god and tell the nun she will be forgiven if she has sex with you.<br />
<br />
The hippie gives his thanks and runs to the nearest costume shop.<br />
<br />
Later that evening the hippie gets ready for his big night and drives down to the graveyard and sees the nun praying, on her knees. He says &#8220;Behold, I have heard your prayers and you shall be forgiven if you have sex with me!&#8221;<br />
<br />
The nun agrees but asks if they can have anal sex in order to keep her virginity. The hippie agrees and once they are finished the hippie jumps back and pulls off his mask and says &#8220;Surpise, its me the Hippie!&#8221;<br />
<br />
The nun jumps up and pulls off her mask and says &#8220;Surprise, its me the bus driver!&#8221;</div></div><hr />

<br />
&#8220;Well, it was like this,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I was having a quiet round of golf with my wife, when at a difficult hole, we both sliced our balls into a pasture of cows. We went to look for them, and while I was rooting around, noticed one of the cows had something white at its rear end. I walked over and lifted up the tail, and sure enough, there was a golf ball with my wife&#8217;s monogram on it&#8211; stuck right in the middle of the cow&#8217;s butt.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s when I made my big mistake.&#8221; &#8220;What did you do?&#8221; asks the doctor.<br />

&#8220;Well, I lifted the cow&#8217;s tail again and yelled to my wife, &#8220;Hey, this looks like yours!&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember much after that!&#8221;<br />

Kramer just faints dead away and falls to the floor. The big dude kneels down and brings him to, by slapping his face and shaking him. He asks, &#8220;Are you Ok?&#8221;<br />

In a very weak voice Kramer says, &#8220;Excuse me, but what did you just say to me?&#8221; The big dude says, &#8220;When I saw the curious look on your face, I just figured I&#8217;d give you the answers to the questions everyone always asks me. &#8220;I&#8217;m 7 feet tall, weigh 350 lbs, have a 20 inch penis, my testicles weigh 3 lbs each, and my name is Turner Brown.&#8221;<br />

---New Joke---<br />
King Arthur was preparing to go out on an expedition and would be away from Camelot for an indefinite period of time. King Arthur was worried about leaving Queen Guinevere alone with all those Knights of the Round Table. So he went to Merlin for some advice.<br />
<br />
After explaining his predicament to Merlin, the wizard looked thoughtful, and said that he&#8217;d see if he could come up with something, and asked him to come back in a week.<br />
<br />
A week later, King Arthur was back in Merlin&#8217;s laboratory where the good wizard was showing him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt, except that it had a rather large hole in the most obvious place. &#8220;This is no good, Merlin!&#8221; the king exclaimed, &#8220;Look at this opening. How is this supposed to protect m&#8217;lady, the Queen?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Ah, sire, just observe.&#8221; said Merlin as he searched his cluttered work bench until he found what he was looking for. He then selected his most worn-out wand, one that he was going to discard anyway. He then inserted it in the gaping aperture of the chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut it neatly in two.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Merlin, you are a genius!&#8221; said the greatful monarch, &#8220;Now I can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected.&#8221;<br />
<br />
After putting Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest. Several years passed until he returned to Camelot.<br />
<br />
Immediately he assembled all his knights in the courtyard and had them drop their trousers for an informal &#8217;short arm&#8217; inspection. Sure enough! Each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some way. All of them except Sir Galahad.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Sir Galahad,&#8221; exclaimed King Arthur, &#8220;The one and only true knight! Only you among all the nobles have been true to me. What is it in my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!&#8221;<br />
<br />
But Sir Galahad was speechless&#8230;<br />

James, as usual, came home really late one Saturday night after being at the bar all night drinking. Not only was he drunk, he was sloppy drunk. He carefully crept into bed next his wife, who fell sleep angry hours earlier, and gave her a goodnight kiss on the check in hopes that she wouldn&#8217;t wake up.<br />
<br />
He awoke in the middle of the night to a strange man standing at the end of his bed wearing a long flowing white robe. &#8220;Who the hell are you,&#8221; demanded James, &#8220;and what are you doing in my bedroom?&#8221; The mysterious man answered &#8220;This is not your bedroom, and my name is St. Peter&#8221;.<br />
<br />
James didn&#8217;t take the news so well&#8230; &#8220;You mean I&#8217;m dead! That can&#8217;t be, I have so much to live for, I haven&#8217;t even said goodbye to my family&#8230; you&#8217;ve got to send me back right away!&#8221;<br />
<br />
St. Peter replied &#8220;You cannot go back as you were, you have passed away James. However, you can be reincarnated - but there is a catch. We can only send you back as a dog or a hen.&#8221; James was devastated, but knowing that there was a farm just down the road from his house, he asked to be sent back as a hen.<br />
<br />
A flash of light later, he was covered in feathers and clucking around pecking at corn on the ground. &#8220;This ain&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; he thought until he felt a strange feeling churning inside him. The farmyard rooster strolled over and said &#8220;So you&#8217;re the new hen, huh? How are you enjoying your first day here?&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s not so bad&#8221; replies James, &#8220;but I have this strange feeling inside like I&#8217;m about to explode&#8221;. &#8220;You&#8217;re ovulating&#8221; explained the rooster, &#8220;haven&#8217;t you ever laid an egg before?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Never&#8221; replies James.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well just relax and let it happen.&#8221;<br />
<br />
And so he did, and just a few uncomfortable seconds later an egg pops out from under his tail. An immense feeling of relief swept over him - emotions got the better of him as he experienced the joy motherhood for the first time. When he laid his second egg, the feeling of happiness was overwhelming and he knew that being reincarnated as a hen was the best thing that ever happened to him&#8230; ever!<br />
<br />
The joy of motherhood continued to build and, just as he was just about to lay his third egg, he felt an enormous smack on the back of his head and heard his wife shout &#8220;James, wake up you drunken bas*ard, you&#8217;re sh*tting the bed!&#8221;<br />

The bartender screams at the guy, &#8220;Did you see what your monkey just did?&#8221; &#8220;No, what?&#8221; says the guy. &#8220;He just ate the cue ball off my pool table - whole!&#8221; says the bartender. &#8220;Yeah, that doesn&#8217;t surprise me, he eats everything in sight. Quite an appetite. I&#8217;ll pay for the cue ball and other things he ate.&#8221; He the finishes his drink, pays the bill, and leaves. Two weeks later he&#8217;s back at the same bar again, monkey by his side as usual. He orders a drink and the monkey starts running around the bar again.<br />
<br />
While the man is drinking, the monkey finds a maraschino cherry on the bar. He grabs it, sticks it up his butt, pulls it out, and eats it. The bartender is disgusted. &#8220;Did you see what your monkey did?&#8221; &#8220;What this time?&#8221; asks the patron. &#8220;Well, he stuck a cherry up his butt, then pulled it out and ate it!&#8221; says the barkeeper.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Yeah, that doesn&#8217;t surprise me,&#8221; replies the patron. &#8220;He still eats everything in sight, but ever since he ate that damn cue ball he measures it first!</div></div><hr />

On the way to the office he regretted what he had done, realizing that the whole event had not been worth the price So he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclose the following typed note:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Dear Madam:<br />
<br />
Enclosed find check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment. I am not sending the amount agreed upon, because when I rented the place, I was under the impression that:<br />
<br />
#1 - it had never been occupied;<br />
#2 - there was plenty of heat; and<br />
#3 - it was small enough to make me feel cozy and at home.<br />
<br />
However, I found out that it had been previously occupied, that there wasn&#8217;t any heat, and that it was entirely too large.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note :<br />
<br />
&#8220;Dear Sir:<br />
<br />
First of all, I cannot understand how you could expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there is plenty of it, if you know how to turn it on. Regarding the space, the apartment is indeed of regular size, but if you don&#8217;t have enough furniture to fill it, please do not blame the management.<br />
<br />
Please send the rent in full or we will be forced to contact your present landlady.&#8221;<br />

---new joke---<br />
<br />
A doctor had the reputation of helping couples increase the joy in their sex life, but alw ays promised not to take a case if he felt he couldn&#8217;t help. The Browns came into see the successful doctor and he gave them thorough physical exams, psychological exams, and various tests. Finally, he concluded, &#8220;Yes, I am happy to say that I can help you.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;On your way home from my office stop at the grocery store and buy some grapes and doughnuts. Go home, take off your clothes, and you, sir, roll the grapes across the floor until you make a bulls eye in your wife&#8217;s love canal. Then on hands and knees you must crawl to her like a leopard and retrieve the grape using only your tongue.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Then next, ma&#8217;am, you must take the doughnuts and from across the room, toss them at your husband until you make a ringer around his love pole. Then like a lioness, you must crawl to him and consume the doughnut.&#8221; The couple went home and their sex life became more and more wonderful.<br />
<br />
They told their friends, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Green that they should see the good doctor. The doctor greeted the Greens and said he would not take the case unless he felt that he could help them; so he conducted the physical exams and the same battery of tests.<br />
<br />
Then he told the Greens the bad news. &#8220;I cannot help you, so I will not take your money. I believe your sex life is as good as it will ever be, I cannot help.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The Greens pleaded with him, and said, &#8220;You helped our friends the Browns, now please, please, help us.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well, all right&#8221;, the doctor said. &#8220;On your way home from the office, stop at the grocery store and buy some apples and a box of cheerios&#8230; &#8220;</div></div><hr />

A 6 year old and a 4 year old are upstairs in their bedroom. &#8220;You know what?&#8221; says the 6 year old. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s about time we started cussing.&#8221; The 4 year old nods his head in approval. The 6 year old continues, &#8220;When we go downstairs for breakfast, I&#8217;m gonna say something with hell and you say something with ass.&#8221; The 4 year old agrees with enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
When the mother walks into the kitchen and asks the 6 year old what he wants for breakfast, he replies, &#8220;Aw, hell, Mom, I guess I&#8217;ll have some Cheerios.&#8221; WHACK! He flies out of his chair, tumbles across the kitchen floor, gets up, and runs upstairs crying his eyes out, with his mother in hot pursuit, slapping his rear with every step. His Mom locks him in his room and shouts,&#8221;You can stay there until I let you out!&#8221; She then comes back downstairs, looks at the 4 year old and asks with a stern voice, &#8220;And what do YOU want for breakfast, young man?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he blubbers, &#8220;but you can bet your fat ass it won&#8217;t be Cheerios.&#8221;<br />
--New Joke---<br />
In Pharmacology, all drugs have two names, a trade name and generic name. For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has a generic name of Acetaminophen. Aleve is also called Naproxen. Amoxil is also called Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.<br />
<br />
The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra. After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin. Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.<br />
<br />
Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer. It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one. Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of &#8216;cocktails&#8217;, &#8216;highballs&#8217; and just good old-fashioned &#8217;stiff drink&#8217;. Pepsi will market the new occasion by the name of: Mount &amp; Do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right about that time a minivan passed by with a sign on the side of it that read: &#8220;Jesus Saves.&#8221; &#8220;How come you don&#8217;t stop them?!&#8221; asked one of the girls. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a little different,&#8221; the officer replied&#8230; &#8220;their sign pertains to religion.&#8221;<br />

The two ladies of the night pouted a bit, but they took their sign down and drove off peacefully. The following day the same police officer was running radar when he noticed the same two young ladies driving around with another sign on their car.

---New Joke---<br />
It&#8217;s the Spring of 1957 and Lewis goes to pick up his date. He&#8217;s a pretty hip guy with his own car. When he goes to the front door, the girl&#8217;s father answers and invites him in. &#8220;Mary Jane&#8217;s not ready yet, so why don&#8217;t you have a seat?,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s cool&#8221; says Lewis.<br />
<br />
Mary Jane&#8217;s father asks Lewis what they&#8217;re planning to do. Lewis replies politely that they will probably just go to the soda shop or a movie.<br />
<br />
Mary Jane&#8217;s father responds &#8220;why don&#8217;t you two go out and screw? I hear all the cool kids are doing it.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Naturally, this comes as a quite a surprise to Lewis - so he asks Mary Jane&#8217;s Dad to repeat it. &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; says Mary Jane&#8217;s father, &#8220;Mary Jane really likes to screw; she&#8217;ll screw all night if we let her!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Well, this just made Lewis&#8217; eyes light up, and his plan for the evening was beginning to look pretty good. A few minutes later, Mary Jane comes downstairs in her little poodle skirt and announces that she&#8217;s ready to go. Almost breathless with anticipation, Lewis escorts his date out the front door.<br />
<br />
About 20 minutes later, Mary Jane rushes back into the house, slams the door behind her, and screams at her father:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Dammit Daddy! It&#8217;s called the TWIST!&#8221;<br />

---New Joke---<br />
A man with a bad stomach ache goes to his local doctor and asks him what he can do. The doctor replies that the illness is quite serious but can be cured with a small course of two suppositories inserted deep into the rectum.<br />
<br />
The man agrees and the doctor tells him to bend over, and shoves the thing way up his behind. The doctor then hands him the second dose and tells him to do the same thing in six hours time using rubber gloves and KY-Jelly or something.<br />
<br />
So, the man goes home and later that evening tries to get the second suppository inserted, but he finds he cannot reach himself properly to obtain the required depth. Thus, he calls his wife over and tells her what to do. The wife nods, puts one hand on his shoulder to steady him and with the other shoves the medicine home.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the man screams in disgust.<br />
<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter hun?&#8221; asked his wife. &#8220;Did I hurt you?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;No,&#8221; replies the man, &#8220;but I just realized that when the doctor did that, he had BOTH hands on my shoulders.&#8221;</div></div><hr />

Tyrone asked his work buddy, Robert, one morning, &#8220;Man, why you always so damn happy when you come to work every day?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Robert replied, &#8220;That&#8217;s because I make love to my wife every morning before work.&#8221;<br />

Amazed, Tyrone asked him how he gets his wife to make love to him every morning.<br />
<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; Robert said. &#8220;I just tell her this little poem that I made up. She loves it!.<br />
<br />
It goes like this: &#8220;Blond hair, blond hair, eyes so blue. I love waking up and making love to you!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Tyrone said, &#8220;Man, you white guys are so damn sentimental.&#8221; But he decided it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to give it a try. So he spent the rest of the day thinking of a poem for his wife. The next day Tyrone showed up to work just beat to hell, bruised eyes, broken nose, fat lip, the works!!<br />
<br />
Robert asked, &#8220;Man, what happened to you?!&#8221;<br />

Tyrone said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, man. I went home and tried your advice. I just told her a poem.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well, what poem did you tell her?&#8221;<br />

One day, John&#8217;s tennis elbow was acting up and he decided to stop in and see a doctor. When he got to the doctor&#8217;s office the nurse told him he could see the doctor in 15 minutes but, first he&#8217;d have to give a urine sample. John said that this was absurd but, the nurse insisted and John complied. 15 minutes later, John was ushered in to see the doctor.<br />
<br />
&#8220;So that tennis elbow is really acting up, huh?&#8221; the doctor said.<br />
<br />
&#8220;The nurse must have told you,&#8221; said John, wondering how the Doctor knew.<br />
<br />
&#8220;No. It was in your urinalysis.&#8221; and the doctor continued to say that he had just purchased this new machine that could diagnose every physical condition with total accuracy based on the urine contents. John didn&#8217;t believe a word of this but he did agree to provide another urine sample on check-up visit.<br />
<br />
Two days later, John was sitting at the kitchen table with his wife and his teenage daughter. He was telling them about this ridiculous machine when he had an idea. John decided to have a little fun with the doctor and pissed in the bottle as did his wife and teenage daughter. Then while walking to his garage he had yet another brainstorm. John put a few drops of oil from his crankcase in the jar and even beat off and put a few drops of semen in the jar. He drove to the doctors office, shook the bottle, then handed it to the nurse. This time his urinalysis took half an hour. Finally, John was ushered in to see the doctor.<br />
<br />
The doctor looked at him with an agitated look in his face and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some bad news. Your daughter is pregnant, your wife&#8217;s got V. D., your car is about to throw a rod, and if you don&#8217;t stop beating off that tennis elbow is never gonna heal!&#8221;</div></div><hr />

&#8220;Dave, don&#8217;t worry about it. You aren&#8217;t the first medical practitioner to sleep with one of their patients, and you won&#8217;t be the last. And you&#8217;re single. Just let it go, Dave.&#8221;<br />

A woman is fast approaching 40 years of age and is without a partner. This situation has her rather depressed due to her long history of failed relationships. After much debate she decides that the best thing to do is to take out a personal ad in the paper:Wanted: A good lover to be my friend; who won&#8217;t beat me and won&#8217;t run out on me.<br />
<br />
After a week or so no one has responded to the ad. She is feeling particularly depressed when the door bell rings.<br />

She opens the door to find a man with no arms and no legs lying on the front porch. Quite surprised at the sight she asks him what he wants.<br />

The new Priest was so nervous at his first mass that he could hardly speak. Before the second week in the pulpit he asked the bishop how he could relax. The Bishop said, &#8220;Next week, put some vodka in the water pitcher. After a few sips, everything should run smoothly.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The next Sunday, the new priest put the suggestion into practice and was able to talk up a storm and felt just great. Upon returning to the rectory, however, he found a note from the Bishop&#8230;<br />
<br />
   1. Next time sip, rather than gulp.<br />
   2. There are 10 Commandments, not 12.<br />
   3. There are 12 Disciples, not 10.<br />
   4. David slew Goliath, he didn&#8217;t kick the shit out of him.<br />

---New Joke---<br />
Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It seemed a little strange, but when another waiter brought our water and utensils I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around and saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.<br />
<br />
When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, &#8220;Why the spoon?&#8221; &#8220;Well, he explained, &#8220;the restaurant&#8217;s owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped utensil. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour.<br />
<br />
If our personnel are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.&#8221;<br />
<br />
As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen, instead of making an extra trip to get it right now.&#8221;<br />
<br />
I was impressed. I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter&#8217;s fly. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter &#8220;Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, certainly!&#8221; Then he lowered his voice. &#8220;Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the restroom. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the restroom by 76.39%.<br />
<br />
I asked &#8220;After you get it out, how do you put it back?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know about the others, but I use the spoon.</div></div><hr />

The curious boy walked up to the geezer and said, &#8220;Hey mister! Why the hell is your head so small?&#8221;<br />
<br />
The old man looked at the boy and replied, &#8220;Boy, if I wasn&#8217;t so damn old, I&#8217;d give you a beating&#8230; but since you remind me of myself at your age, I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The boy listened curiously as the geezer explained, &#8220;One day I was fishing on the pier when I got a huge bite&#8230; And, I said to myself, &#8216;Holy shit! I&#8217;ve caught a whale!&#8217;&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;No kidding?&#8221; pried the boy. The geezer continued, &#8220;But, when I reeled it up, to my surprise, it was a gorgeous mermaid! Well, she looked at me in tremendous fright and said she&#8217;d grant me one wish if I let her free&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;And?&#8221; interjected the boy. &#8220;Well, after some quick thought, I looked at her and said, &#8216;How about a little head?&#8217;&#8221;<br />

A family is sitting around the supper table. The son asks his father, &#8220;Dad, how many kinds of breasts are there?<br />
<br />
The father, surprised, answers, &#8220;Well, son, there are three kinds of breasts. In her twenties, a woman&#8217;s breasts are like melons, round and firm. In her thirties to forties, they are like pears, still nice but hanging a bit. After fifty, they are like onions.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Onions?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Yes, you see them and they make you cry.&#8221;<br />
<br />
This infuriated the wife and daughter. So the daughter said &#8221; Mom, how many kinds of penises are there?&#8221;<br />
<br />
The mother, surprised, smiles and looks at her daughter and answers, &#8220;Well dear, a man goes through three phases. In a man&#8217;s twenties, his penis is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his thirties and forties, it is a birch, flexible but reliable. After his fifties, it is like a Christmas tree.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;A Christmas tree?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Yes, dead from the root up and the balls are for decoration only!&#8221;<br />
---New Joke---<br />
Just imagine sitting in traffic on your way to work and hearing this. Many Sydney folks did hear this on the FOX FM morning show in Sydney. The DJs play a game where they award winners great prizes. The game is called &#8220;Mate Match&#8220;.<br />
<br />
The DJs call someone at work and ask if they are married or seriously involved with someone. If the contestant answers &#8220;yes&#8221;, he or she is then asked 3 random yet highly personal questions. The person is also asked to divulge the name of their partner with phone number for verification. If their partner answers those same three questions correctly, they both win the prize.<br />
<br />
One particular game, however, several months ago made the Harbour City drop to its knees with laughter and is possibly the funniest thing you&#8217;ve heard yet. Anyway, here&#8217;s how it all went down:<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Hey! This is Ed on FOX-FM. Have you ever heard of &#8216;Mate Match&#8217;?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Contestant: (laughing) &#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Great! Then you know we&#8217;re giving away a trip to the Gold Coast if you win. What is your name? First only please.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Contestant: &#8220;Brian.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Brian, are you married or what?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing nervously) &#8220;Yes, I am married.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Thank you. Now, what is your wife&#8217;s name? First only please.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;Sara.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Is Sara at work, Brian?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;She is gonna kill me.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Stay with me here, Brian! Is she at work?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing) &#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s at work.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Okay, first question - when was the last time you had sex?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;About 8 o&#8217;clock this morning.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Atta boy, Brian.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing sheepishly) &#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Question #2 - How long did it last?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;About 10 minutes.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Wow! You really want that trip, huh? No one would ever have said that if a trip wasn&#8217;t at stake.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;Yeah, that trip sure would be nice.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Okay. Final question. Where did you have sex at 8 o&#8217;clock<br />
this morning?<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing hard) &#8220;I, ummm, I, well&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;This sounds good, Brian. Where was it at?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;Not that it was all that great, but her mum is staying with us for a couple of weeks&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Uh huh&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;&#8230;and the Mother-In-Law was in the shower at the time.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Atta boy, Brian.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;On the kitchen table.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Not that great?? That is more adventure than the previous hundred times I&#8217;ve done it. Okay folks, I will put Brian on hold, get this wife&#8217;s work number and call her up. You listen to this.&#8221;<br />
<br />
[3 minutes of commercials follow.]<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Okay audience; let&#8217;s call Sarah, shall we?&#8221; (Touch tones&#8230;..ringing&#8230;.)<br />
<br />
Clerk: &#8220;Kinkos.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Hey, is Sarah around there somewhere?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Clerk: &#8220;This is she.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Sarah, this is Ed with FOX-FM. We are live on the air right now and I&#8217;ve been talking with Brian for a couple of hours now.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) &#8220;A couple of hours?&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Well, a while now. He is on the line with us. Brian knows not to give any answers away or you&#8217;ll lose. Sooooooo&#8230; do you know the rules of &#8216;Mate Match&#8217;?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: &#8220;No.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Good!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing)<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) &#8220;Brian, what the hell are you up to?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing) &#8220;Just answer his questions honestly, okay? Be completely honest.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Yeah yeah yeah. Sure. Now, I will ask you 3 questions, Sarah. If your answers match Brian&#8217;s answers, then the both of you will be off to the Gold Coast for 5 days on us.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Alright. When did you last have sex, Sarah?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: &#8220;Oh God, Brian&#8230;.uh, this morning before Brian went to work.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;What time?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: &#8220;Around 8 this morning.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Very good. Next question. How long did it last?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: &#8220;12, 15 minutes maybe.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Hmmmm. That&#8217;s close enough. I am sure she is trying to protect his manhood. We&#8217;ve got one last question, Sarah. You are one question away from a trip to the Gold Coast. Are you ready?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;Where did you have it?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: &#8220;OH MY GOD, BRIAN!! You didn&#8217;t tell them that did you?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Brian: &#8220;Just tell him, honey.&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: &#8220;What is bothering you so much, Sarah?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Sarah: &#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
DJ: Come on Sarah&#8230;..where did you have it?<br />
<br />
Sarah: &#8220;Up the a$$&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<br />
After a long pause, the DJ said, &#8220;Folks, we need to take a station break&#8221;<br />

Over the last month or so I became the victim of a clever scam while out shopping, which has be quite traumatic. Don&#8217;t be naive enough to think that it couldn&#8217;t happen to you! Here&#8217;s how the scam works.<br />
<br />
Two seriously good looking 21 year old girls come over to your car as you&#8217;re loading stuff into your trunk. They both start washing your windshield with a rag while their cleavage is practically falling out of their skimpy T-shirts. It&#8217;s impossible not to look.<br />
<br />
When you thank them or offer a tip, they say no and instead ask you for a lift to another Wal-Mart. You agree and they get in the back seat. On the way, they start having sex with each other. Then one of them climbs over into the front seat and gives you a blowjob, while the other one steals your wallet.<br />
<br />
I had my wallet stolen on the 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th of last month and the 2nd of this month, 4th, three times on the 5th, three times just yesterday, and very likely again today.<br />

The midget went to the doctor and told him about his problem. The doctor told him to drop his pants and he would have a look. The midget dropped his pants. The doctor stood him up onto the examining table, and started to examine him. The doc put one finger under his left testicle and told the midget to turn his head and cough, the usual method used to check for a hernia.<br />

&#8220;Aha!&#8221; mumbled the doc and, as he put his finger under the right testicle, he asked the midget to cough again.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Aha!&#8221; said the doctor again, and reached for his surgical scissors. Snip-snip-snip-snip on the right side, then snip-snip-snip-snip on the left side. The midget was so scared he was afraid to look, but noted with amazement that the snipping did not hurt. The doctor then told the midget to walk around the examining room to see if his testicles still hurt.<br />
<br />
The midget was absolutely delighted as he walked around and discovered his testicles were no longer aching.<br />
<br />
The doctor said, &#8220;How does that feel now?&#8221; The midget replied, &#8220;Perfect Doc, and I didn&#8217;t even feel it. What did you do?&#8221;<br />

Long Joke o.o :<br />
<br />
Dear Wife,<br />
During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often:<br />
<br />
    * 54 times the sheets were just cleaned<br />
    * 17 times it was too late<br />
    * 49 times you were too tired<br />
    * 20 times it was too hot<br />
    * 15 times you pretended to be sleep<br />
    * 22 times you had a headache<br />
    * 17 times you were afraid of waking the baby<br />
    * 16 times you said you were too sore<br />
    * 12 times it was the wrong time of the month<br />
    * 19 times you had to get up early<br />
    * 9 times you said weren&#8217;t in the mood<br />
    * 7 times you were sunburned<br />
    * 6 times you were watching the late show<br />
    * 5 times you didn&#8217;t want to mess up your new hairdo<br />
    * 3 times you said the neighbors would hear us<br />
    * 9 times you said your mother would hear us<br />
<br />
Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because:<br />
<br />
    * 6 times you just laid there<br />
    * 8 times you reminded me there&#8217;s a crack in the ceiling<br />
    * 4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with<br />
    * 7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished<br />
    * 1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move<br />

I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn&#8217;t get more than you did:<br />
<br />
    * 5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat<br />
    * 36 times you did not come home at all<br />
    * 21 times you didn&#8217;t come with energy<br />
    * 33 times you came too soon<br />
    * 19 times you went soft before you got in<br />
    * 38 times you worked too late<br />
    * 10 times you got cramps in your toes<br />
    * 29 times you had to get up early to play golf<br />
    * 2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you in the balls<br />
    * 4 times you got it stuck in your zipper<br />
    * 3 times you had a cold and your nose was running<br />
    * 2 times you had a splinter in your finger<br />
    * 20 times you lost the motion after thinking about it all day<br />
    * 6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book<br />
    * 98 times you were too busy watching TV<br />
<br />
Of the times we did get together:<br />
<br />
    * The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets.<br />
    * I wasn&#8217;t talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, &#8220;Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?&#8221;<br />
    * The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe.</div></div><hr />

A Mom comes to visit her son John who&#8217;s living with a female roommate named Samantha. John&#8217;s mother doesn&#8217;t like the idea of her son living with a woman, as he&#8217;s in college and doesn&#8217;t need any distractions. To ease his mother&#8217;s worries, John invites her to stay for dinner.<br />
<br />
During the course of the meal, his mother couldn&#8217;t help but notice how pretty John&#8217;s roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two and this had only made her more curious.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and his roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom&#8217;s thoughts, John volunteered, &#8220;I know what your thinking Mom, but I assure you, Samantha and I are just roommates.&#8221;<br />
<br />
About a week later, Samantha came to John saying, &#8220;Ever since your mother came to dinner, I&#8217;ve been unable to find the silver peanut butter jar. You don&#8217;t suppose she took it, do you?&#8221; John said, &#8220;Well, I doubt it, but I&#8217;ll email her, just to be sure.&#8221;<br />
<br />
So he sat down and wrote:<br />
<br />
    Dear Mother,<br />
    I&#8217;m not saying that you &#8216;did&#8217; take the peanut butter jar from my house, I&#8217;m not saying that you &#8216;did not&#8217; take the peanut butter jar. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.<br />
<br />
    Love,<br />
    John<br />
<br />
Several days later, John received an email from his Mother which read:<br />
<br />
    Dear Son,<br />
    I&#8217;m not saying that you &#8216;do&#8217; sleep with Samantha, and I&#8217;m not saying that you &#8216;do not&#8217; sleep with Samantha. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the peanut butter jar under her pillow&#8230;<br />
<br />
    Love,<br />
    Mom<br />

A crusty old man walks into the local First Baptist Church and says to the secretary, &#8220;I would like to join this damn church.&#8221; The astonished woman replies, &#8220;I beg your pardon, sir. I must have misunderstood you. What did you say?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Listen up, damn it. I said I want to join this damn church!&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry sir, but that kind of language is not tolerated in this church.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The secretary leaves her desk and goes into the pastor&#8217;s study to inform him of her situation. The pastor agrees that the secretary does not have to listen to that foul language. They both return to her office and the pastor asks the old geezer, &#8220;Sir, what seems to be the problem here?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;There is no damn problem,&#8221; the man says. &#8220;I just won $200 million bucks in the damn lottery and I want to join this damn church to get rid of some of this damn money. &#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the pastor. &#8220;And is this b*tch giving you a hard time?&#8221;<br />

---New Joke---<br />
Herman and Martha were happily married for nearly forty years. The only friction in their marriage was caused by the husband&#8217;s habit of breaking wind nearly every morning as he awoke. The noise would always wake up Martha and the smell would cause her eyes to water as she would choke and gasp for air. Nearly every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping one in the morning. Herman told her that he couldn&#8217;t help it.<br />
<br />
She begged him to visit a doctor to see if anything could be done, but the husband wouldn&#8217;t hear of it. He told her that it was just a natural bodily function, and then he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the fumes away with her hands. She told him that there was nothing natural about it and if he didn&#8217;t stop, he was one day going to &#8220;fart his guts out.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The years went by and Martha continued to suffer and Herman continued to ignore her warnings about &#8220;farting his guts out&#8221; until one Christmas morning.<br />
<br />
Before dawn, Martha went downstairs to prepare the family feast. She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed potatoes, gravy and of course a turkey. While she was taking out the turkeys innards, a thought occurred to the wife as to how she might solve her husband&#8217;s problem.<br />
<br />
With a devilish grin on her face, she placed the turkey guts into a bowl and quietly walked upstairs hours before her flatulent husband would awake. While he was still soundly asleep, she pulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her husband&#8217;s jockey shorts. She then placed all of the turkey guts into her husband&#8217;s underwear, pulled them up, replaced the covers and tiptoed back downstairs to finish preparing the family meal.<br />
<br />
Several hours later she heard Herman awake with his normal loud ass trumpeting. This was soon followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs bathroom. Martha could not control herself and her eyes began to tear up as she rolled on the floor laughing. After years of putting up with him she had finally gotten even.<br />
<br />
About twenty minutes later, Herman came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror in his eyes. She bit her lip to keep from laughing and she asked him what was the matter.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Honey,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You were right - all those years you warned me and I didn&#8217;t listen to you.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Martha.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well, you always told me that I would end up farting my guts out one of these days and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God and these two fingers, I think I got them all back in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An 85-year-old man went to his doctor&#8217;s office to get a sperm count. The doctor gave the man a jar and said, &#8220;Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The next day the 85-year-old man reappeared at the doctor&#8217;s office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day.The doctor asked what happened and the man explained: &#8220;Well, doc, it&#8217;s like this - First I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing.<br />
<br />
Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, and still nothing. We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit and she even tried squeezin&#8217; it between her knees, but still nothing.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The doctor was shocked! &#8220;You asked your neighbor?&#8221;<br />
<br />
The old man replied, &#8220;Yep. And no matter what we tried, we still couldn&#8217;t get the jar open.<br />

Little Johnny kept getting into trouble for disrupting his third grade class, seems he was regularly busting out obnoxiouysly loud farts.<br />
<br />
His teacher kept him after school to have a talk with him and, maybe, resolve the problem. When she insisted on knowing why he exhibited such offensive behavior, Little Johnny said, &#8220;I do it because I can do it better than anybody, and I&#8217;m proud of it.&#8221; The teacher, in a moment of despiration, says, &#8220;If I show you I can do it better than you, will you stop?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Little Johnny agreed and the teacher placed two pieces of paper on the floor with identical piles of chalk dust on each one. Johnny dropped his pants, squatted down, farted and blew all but a tiny little speck of dust off the paper. The teacher dropped her panties, lifted her skirt, squatted down and farted but when she was done, there wasn&#8217;t a trace of chalk dust left on the paper.<br />
<br />
Johnny was astonished and asked if he could see her do it again. She was willing and as she repeated the process, Johnny peeked underneath her skirt.<br />
<br />
&#8220;No wonder you won!&#8221; he exclaimed indignantly,&#8221;you&#8217;ve got a Double-Barrel!&#8221;<br />

---New Joke---<br />
A middle-aged businessman took a young woman half his age as his wife. The fantasy of having a young woman in his bed soon became a nightmare when he found that he could not last long enough to satisfy his young bride.<br />
<br />
His wife, as understanding as she was exciting, told him that all was well even if he was quick to get out of the saddle.<br />
<br />
Determined to satisfy this sweet young thing, the man visited the doctor to get some advice.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Doctor, I can&#8217;t seem to hold back for very long when I make love to my young wife and I can&#8217;t satisfy her. What can I do?&#8221;<br />
<br />
The doctor smiled, patted him on the shoulder, and said in a professional manner, &#8220;Try a bit of self-stimulation before having intercourse with your wife and you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;ll last longer and ultimately satisfy her.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Okay, Doctor. If you think that will help.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Later that afternoon, his young bride called him at work to let him know that she would be attacking him at the front door when he arrived home.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Be prepared, my darling. I&#8217;m going to ravish you,&#8221; she cooed over the phone.<br />
<br />
Undaunted, the man decided to follow the doctor&#8217;s advice. But where? In the office? The Xerox room? What if someone walked in on him?<br />
<br />
He got in his truck and began the journey home. Soon he decided he would find a spot on the road to pull over, climb underneath the truck and pretend to be inspecting the rear axle, and do the deed there.<br />
<br />
A moment later, he pulled over, crawled beneath the truck, closed his eyes tightly, fantasized about his young wife, and began his &#8220;therapy&#8221;.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, just as he was about to complete his therapy session, he felt someone tugging on his pants leg. Keeping his eyes tightly shut to avoid ruining the fantasy he was enjoying, he said, &#8220;Yes?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Sir, I&#8217;m with the Police Department. Could you tell me what you are doing, please?&#8221; said the officer.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Yes, officer, I&#8217;m inspecting my truck&#8217;s rear axle,&#8221; he replied confidently.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you check the brakes while you&#8217;re down there. Your truck rolled down the hill a few minutes ago.&#8221;</div></div><hr />

One was a Duke University Law School graduate from an upper crust family; well-bred, well-connected, and all that goes with it. The other finalist was a redneck from Southeast Alabama A&amp;M.<br />
<br />
The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a four-line poem in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain the word &#8220;Timbuktu&#8221;.<br />
<br />
The Duke graduate went first. About thirty seconds after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem:<br />
<br />
Slowly across the desert sand Trekked the dusty caravan. Men on camels, two by two Destination-Timbuktu.<br />
<br />
The audience went wild! How, they wondered, could the redneck top that?! The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought. Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:<br />
<br />
Tim and me, a-huntin&#8217; we went. Met three whores in a pop-up tent. They was three, we was two, So I bucked one and Timbuktu<br />

When the math professor&#8217;s wife returns home from work, she finds an envelope on the living room table. She opens it and finds a letter from her husband:<br />
<br />
    My dearest wife,<br />
<br />
    We have been married for nearly thirty years, and I still love you as much as on the day I proposed. You must realize, however, that you are now 54 years old and no longer able to satisfy certain needs I still have. I very much hope that you are not hurt to learn that, while you&#8217;re reading this, I&#8217;m in a hotel room with an 18-year-old freshman girl from my calculus class. I&#8217;ll be home before midnight.<br />
<br />
    Your husband, who will never stop loving you.<br />
<br />
When the professor returns from the hotel shortly before midnight, he also finds an envelope in the living room. He opens it and reads:<br />
<br />
    My beloved husband,<br />
<br />
    You may recall that you, too, are 54 years old and no longer able to satisfy certain needs I still have. I thus hope that you are not hurt to learn that, while you&#8217;re reading this, I am in a hotel room with the 18-year-old pool boy.<br />
<br />
    Your loving wife.<br />
<br />
    P.S. As a mathematician, you are certainly aware of the fact that 18 goes into 54 many more times than 54 goes into 18. Therefore, don&#8217;t stay up and wait for me.</div></div><hr />

As he settled in, he glanced up and saw the most beautiful woman boarding the plane. He soon realized she was heading straight towards his seat. As fate would have it, she took the seat right beside his.<br />
<br />
Eager to strike up a conversation he blurted out, &#8220;Business trip or pleasure?&#8221; She turned, smiled and said, &#8220;Business. I&#8217;m going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Chicago.&#8221;<br />

He swallowed hard. Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs.Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s your business role at this convention?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Lecturer,&#8221; she responded. &#8220;I use information that Ihave learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Really?&#8221; he said. &#8220;And what kind of myths are there?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well, she explained, &#8220;one popular myth is that African American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait.<br />
<br />
Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent who are the best. I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck.&#8221;<br />

Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t really be discussing all of this with you. I don&#8217;t even know your name.&#8221;<br />

A well respected Captain in the Marines was transferred to a remote desert outpost. On his orientation tour he noticed a very old, seedy looking camel tied out behind the enlisted men&#8217;s barracks.<br />
<br />
He asked the First Sergeant leading the tour, &#8220;Why&#8217;s a camel tied out behind the barracks?&#8221;<br />
<br />
The First Sergeant replied, &#8220;Well sir, it&#8217;s a long way from any where, and the men have natural sexual urges, so when they do&#8230; uh&#8230; we have the camel.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The Captain said, &#8220;Well, I suppose if it&#8217;s good for morale, then I guess it&#8217;s all right with me.&#8221;<br />
<br />
After he had been stationed at the fort for six long, lonely months, the Captain just couldn&#8217;t control his sexual angst any longer. He ordered to his First Sergeant to, &#8220;Bring the camel to my tent!&#8221;<br />

The First Sergeant shrugged his shoulders, looked at the other men, and led the camel into the Captain&#8217;s quarters.<br />

A couple mintutes later the Captain emerges from his tent, fastening his trousers, almost beaming with pride boasted &#8221;So, Sergeant, is that how the enlisted men do it?&#8221;<br />

During a moment of brilliance, and a man buys several sheep in hopes of breeding them for wool. He figured it&#8217;d be an excellent way to make some extra money. After several weeks, he notices that none of the sheep are getting pregnant and calls a veterinarian for help. The vet tells him he should try artificial insemination.<br />
<br />
Now the guy doesn&#8217;t have the slightest idea what this means but, not wanting to display his ignorance, only asks the vet how he&#8217;d know when the sheep are pregnant. The vet tells him that they&#8217;ll stop standing around and will instead lay down and wallow in the grass when they are pregnant.<br />
<br />
The man hangs up and gives it some thought. He comes to the conclusion that artificial insemination means HE has to impregnate the sheep. So, he loads the sheep into his truck, drives them out into the woods, has sex with them all, brings them back and goes to bed.<br />
<br />
The next morning, he wakes and looks out at the sheep. Seeing that they are all still standing around, he concludes that the first try didn&#8217;t take, and loads them in the truck again. He drives them out to the woods, bangs each sheep twice for good measure, brings them back and goes to bed.<br />
<br />
The next morning he wakes to find the sheep still just standing around. One more try, he tells himself, and proceeds to load them up and drive them out to the woods. He spends all day shagging the sheep and, upon returning home, falls listlessly into bed.<br />
<br />
The next morning, he cannot even raise himself from the bed to look at the sheep. He asks his wife to look out and tell him if the sheep are laying in the grass. &#8220;Nope,&#8221; she says, &#8220;they&#8217;re all in the truck and one of them is honking the horn.&#8221;<br />

Little Johnny&#8217;s teacher got up in front of the class and announced they were going to play a guessing game! The teacher said, &#8220;I have something behind my back. It&#8217;s red in color and round. It&#8217;s soft, but it&#8217;s hard.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Johnny raised his hand and said, &#8220;I know, it&#8217;s a red rubber ball.&#8221; The teacher said, &#8220;No Johnny, it&#8217;s an apple, but I like the way that you think.&#8221;<br />

<br />
Johnny raised his hand again and said, &#8220;Teacher teacher, I know, it&#8217;s an orange rubber ball.&#8221; The teacher looked at Johnny and said, &#8220;No Johnny, it&#8217;s an orange, but I like the way that you think.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Johnny was now getting the hang of it so he asked the teacher if he could try one. Johnny grabbed an object and put it behind his back and said, &#8220;I have something behind my back. It&#8217;s pink in color and it&#8217;s loooong. It&#8217;s soft, but it&#8217;s haaaard.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The teacher, getting upset, yelled at Johnny, &#8220;Now Johnny, I&#8217;m going to have to tell the principal about this perverted behavior.&#8221; Johnny stopped her and said, &#8220;But, teacher, all I have is my pink eraser - but I like the way you think!&#8221;</div></div><hr />

The bike seems even better than a new one even though it&#8217;s 10 years old, really shiny and in absolute mint condition.<br />
<br />
He immediately buys it, on the spot, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s quite simple, really,&#8221; says the seller, &#8220;whenever the bike is outside and it&#8217;s going to rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain.&#8221; And he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.<br />
<br />
That night, his girlfriend, Sandy, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they ride the bike over there. But, just before they enter the house, Sandy stops him and says, &#8220;I have to tell you something about my family before we go in&#8230; When we eat dinner, we don&#8217;t talk. In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.&#8221; &#8220;No problem,&#8221; he says. And in they go.<br />
<br />
John is shocked at the sight. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.<br />
<br />
They sit down to dinner and, of course, no one says a word. As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation. He leans over and kisses Sandy. No one says a word. He reaches over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word. He stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and screws her brains out right in front of her parents. His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom definately horrified, but, when he sits back down nobody says a word.<br />
<br />
John, looking over at Sandy&#8217;s mom, things to himself she&#8217;s pretty hot. So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her right there on the dinner table.  His girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total silence.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain. Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket. Suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, &#8220;All right, thats enough, I&#8217;ll do the fucking dishes!&#8221;<br />

A man was approached by co-worker at lunch who invited him out for a few beers after work. The man said that his wife would never go for it, that she does not allow him to go drinking with the guys after work. The co-worker suggested a way to overcome that problem: &#8220;When you get home tonight, sneak into the house, slide down under the sheets, gently pull down your wife&#8217;s panties, and give her oral sex. Women love it, and believe me, she&#8217;ll never mention that you were out late with the boys.&#8221;<br />
<br />
So the man agreed to try it, and went out and enjoyed himself. Late that night, he sneaked into the house, slid down under the sheets, gently slid down his wife&#8217;s panties, and gave her oral sex. She moaned and groaned with pleasure, but after a little while, he realized he had to take a leak, so he told her he&#8217;d be right back, got out of bed and walked down the hall to the bathroom. When he opened the door and went in, he was very surprised to see his wife sitting on the toilet.<br />
<br />
&#8220;How did you get in here?&#8221; he asked.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Shhhhh!!!&#8221; she replied, &#8220;you&#8217;ll wake-up my mother!&#8221;<br />

A nursery school teacher says to her class, &#8220;Who can use the word &#8216;definitely&#8217; in a sentence?&#8221;<br />
<br />
First a little girl says, &#8220;The sky is definitely blue.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The teacher says, &#8220;Sorry, Amy, but the sky can sometimes be gray, or black.&#8221;<br />
<br />
A second little boy says, &#8220;Trees are definitely green.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Sorry, but in the autumn, the trees are brown.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Then little Johnny from the back of the class stands up and asks, &#8220;Does a fart have lumps?&#8221;<br />
<br />
The teacher looks horrified and says, &#8220;Johnny! Of course not!!!&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;OK&#8230;then I DEFINITELY sh*t my pants!&#8221;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seisuke</div><div class="date">04-23-2009, 01:31</div></div><div class="posttext">The beautiful secretary of the president of a bank goes on a sight-seeing tour with a very rich African king who was a very important client. The client, out of the blue, asks her to marry him. Naturally, the secretary is quite taken aback. However, she remembers what her boss told her&#8230; don&#8217;t reject the guy outright. So, she tries to think of a way to dissuade the businessman from wanting to marry her.<br />
<br />
So, after a few minutes, the woman says to the man, &#8220;I will only marry you under three conditions. First, I want my engagement ring to be a 75-carat diamond ring with a matching 200-carat diamond tiara.&#8221; The African king pauses for awhile. Then, he nods his head and says, &#8220;No problem!! I have. I have.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Realizing her first condition was too easy the woman says to the man, &#8220;I want you to build me a 100-room mansion in New York. As a vacation home, I want a chateau built in the middle of the best wine country in France.&#8221; The African king pauses for awhile. He whips out his cellular phone and calls some brokers in New York and in France. He looks at the woman, nods his head and says, &#8220;Okay, okay. I build. I build.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Realizing that she only has one last condition, the secretary knows that she&#8217;d better make this a good one. She takes her time to think and finally she gets an idea. A sure-to-work condition. She squints her eyes, looks at the man and says, rather coldly, &#8220;Since I like sex, I want the man I marry to have a 14-inch penis.&#8221; The man seems a bit disturbed. He cups his face with his hands and rests his elbows on the table, all the while muttering in African dialect.<br />
<br />
Finally, after what seemed like forever, the king shakes his head, looking really sad, and says to the woman, &#8220;Okay, okay. I cut. I cut.&#8221;<br />

There was a cop on his horse waiting to cross the road when Little Johnny, on his new shiny bike, stopped beside him.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Nice bike,&#8221; the cop said, &#8220;did Santa bring it to you?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Yep,&#8221; Little Johnny said, &#8220;he sure did!&#8221;<br />
<br />
The cop looked at the bike and, while handing the boy a $20 ticket, he said &#8220;Next year, tell Santa to put a license plate on the back of it.&#8221;<br />
<br />
To which Little Johnny replied, &#8220;nice horse you got there sir, did Santa bring it to you?&#8221; &#8220;Yea, He sure did,&#8221; said the cop.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the cop, with the most serious little boy tone, Johnny retorted, &#8220;Next year tell Santa to put the dick underneath the horse instead of on top of it!&#8221; and peddled off down the road.<br />

Two married buddies are out drinking one night when one turns to the other and says, &#8220;You know, I don&#8217;t know what else to do Whenever I go home after we&#8217;ve been out drinking, I turn the headlights off before I get to the driveway. I shut off the engine and coast into the garage. I take my shoes off before I go into the house, I sneak up the stairs, I get undressed in the bathroom. I ease into bed and my wife STILL wakes up and yells at me for staying out so late!&#8221;<br />
<br />
His buddy looks at him and says, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re obviously taking the wrong approach. I screech into the driveway, slam the door, storm up the steps, throw my shoes into the closet, jump into bed, slap her on the butt and say, &#8216;You as horny as I am?&#8217; &#8230; and she always acts like she&#8217;s sound asleep!&#8221;</div></div><hr />

He told the woman that he was very sorry but he seemed to have left his wallet at home. &#8220;I will have to go home and come back later.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The woman says, &#8220;Unbutton your shirt.&#8221; So he opens his shirt revealing curly silver hair.<br />

She says, &#8220;That silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me&#8221; and she processed his Social Security application.<br />

<br />
According to the nurse attending, the patient&#8217;s girl friend found the ring in his pants pocket and she got so mad at him, she used petroleum jelly to slip the ring on his penis while he was asleep.<br />

I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s worse:<br />
<br />
1) Having your girl friend find out you&#8217;re married.<br />
2) Explaining to your wife how your wedding ring got on your penis.<br />
3) Or finding out your penis fits through your wedding ring.<br />

Restroom Etiquette<br />

During a good manners and etiquette class being held for young children, the teacher says to her students:<br />
<br />
&#8220;If you were courting a well educated young girl from a prominent family and during a dinner for two you needed to go to the toilet, what would you say to her?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Mike replies: &#8220;Wait a minute, I&#8217;m going for a piss.&#8221;<br />

The teacher says: &#8220;That would be very rude and improper on your part.&#8221;<br />

Charlie replies: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I need to go to the toilet, I&#8217;ll be back in a minute.&#8221;<br />

<br />
Replied the widow, &#8220;I nursed him night and day so of course I know he died of diarrhea. But I thought it would be better for posterity to remember him as a great lover rather than the big shit he always was.&#8221;</div></div><hr />

So the doctor goes and cuts the cord and looks at the child with a crazy look and starts stabbing him with the knife on the chest and stomach... Later he throws the baby on the floor and starts kicking him on the face like if he was kicking a field goal...<br />
<br />
The traumatized parents ask the doctor &quot;WTF ARE YOU FREAKIN DOIN?!!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
The doctor responds &quot;Gotcha!!!... The baby was born dead already&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Eager to impress a future doctor, the chief resident shows him around the facility.<br />
<br />
While discussing current cases and the facility, they stumble across a patient masturbating in his room. &#8220;What condition does he have?&#8221; the student asks. &#8220;He suffers from Seminal Buildup Disorder,&#8221; the resident replies. &#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t ejaculate 20-30 times a day, he&#8217;ll become confused and disoriented.&#8221;<br />
<br />
As the pair continue their tour, the student walks past another room and sees a patient with his pants around ankles, receiving oral sex from a beautiful nurse. &#8220;What about him?&#8221; the student asks. &#8220;What&#8217;s his story?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s the same condition,&#8221; the doctor replies. &#8220;He just has a better health plan.&#8221;<br />
<br />
---New Joke---<br />
A four year old little boy was at the doctor&#8217;s office with his mother in the waiting room when he spotted a pregnant lady on the other side of the room. Having nothing better to do, he walk over to her and inquisitively asks &#8220;Why is your stomach so big?&#8221;<br />
<br />
She replied, &#8220;Im having a baby.&#8221; With big eyes, he replied, &#8220;Is the baby in your stomach?&#8221; She said, &#8220;He sure is.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Then the little boy, with a puzzled look on his face, asked yet another question, &#8220;Is it a good baby?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Oh, yes. It&#8217;s a real good baby.&#8221; At this point the woman is thinking the little boy is incredibly cute and looks foward to what he has to say next&#8230;<br />
<br />
And, much to her suprise, with an even more surprised and shocked look than before, he asks.. &#8220;Then why did you eat him?&#8221;<br />

Little Johnny rushes home from school. He invades the fridge and is scooping out some cherry vanilla ice cream when his mother enters the kitchen. She says, &#8220;Put that away Johnny! You can&#8217;t have ice cream now. It&#8217;s too close to supper time. Go outside and play.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Johnny whimpers and says, &#8220;There&#8217;s no one to play with.&#8221; Trying to placate him, she says, &#8220;OK, I&#8217;ll play with you. What do you want to play?&#8221; He says, &#8220;I wanna play Mommie and Daddy.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Trying not to register surprise, and to further appease him, she says, &#8220;Fine, I&#8217;ll play. What do I do?&#8221; Johnny says, &#8220;You go up to the bedroom and lie down.&#8221; Figuring that she can easily control the situation, she goes upstairs.<br />
<br />
Johnny, feeling a bit cocky, swaggers down the hall and opens the utility closet. He dons his father&#8217;s old fishing hat. As he starts up the stairs he notices a cigarette butt in the ashtray on the end table. He picks it up and slips it in the corner of his mouth. At the top of the stairs he moves to the bedroom doorway.<br />
<br />
His mother raises up and says, &#8220;What do I do now?&#8221; In a gruff manner, Johnny says, &#8220;Get your butt downstairs and get that kid some ice cream!&#8221;<br />

A teacher is explaining biology to her 4th grade students. &#8220;Human beings are the only animals that stutter,&#8221; she says. Little Johnny raises his hand. &#8220;I had a kitty-cat who stuttered,&#8221; he volunteered.<br />
<br />
The teacher, knowing how precious some of these stories could become, asked young Johnny to describe the incident.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he began, &#8220;I was in the back yard with my kitty and the Rottweiler that lives next door got a running start and before we knew it, he jumped over the fence into our yard!<br />
<br />
&#8220;That must&#8217;ve been scary,&#8221; said the teacher.<br />
<br />
&#8220;It sure was!&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;My kitty raised his back, went &#8216;Fffff, Fffff, Fffff&#8217;&#8230; and before he could say &#8220;F*ck!&#8221;, the Rottweiler ate him!&#8221;</div></div><hr />

She told the doctor her problem and he said, &#8220;You have the crabs.&#8221; She informed the doctor that it could not be the crabs because she was an eighty year old virgin.<br />
<br />
She went to another doctor and explained her problem to him. The doctor said, &#8220;You probably have the crabs&#8221;. No&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am an eighty year old virgin.&#8221;<br />

Frustrated, she went to a third doctor.She said, &#8220;Doctor can you help me? I have an itch in my crotch. Don&#8217;t tell me that it is the crabs because I am an eighty year old virgin. It can not be the crabs.&#8221;The doctor said, Jump on the table and let&#8217;s have a look.&#8221; After examining, the doctor proclaimed, &#8220;Ma&#8217;am, your right, you do not have the crabs.

A couple walked into a tourist shop in Jamaica. The Jamaican said to them, I have some special sandals I think you would be interested in. &#8220;Dey makes you wild at sex.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Well, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what the man claimed, but her husband felt he really didn&#8217;t need them, being the sex God he was.<br />
<br />
The husband asked the man, &#8220;How could sandals make you into a sex freak?&#8221; The Jamaican replied, &#8220;Just try dem on, Mon.&#8221; So, the husband, after some badgering from his wife, finally gave in, and tried them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this wild look in his eyes, something his wife hadn&#8217;t seen in many years! In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Jamaican, bent him over a table, yanked down his pants, ripped down his own pants, and grabbed a firm hold of the Jamaican&#8217;s hips.<br />
<br />
The Jamaican then began screaming, &#8220;You got dem on the de wrong feet man! You got dem on de wrong feet!&#8221;<br />

One day a nun was standing on the side of the road waiting for a cab. A cab stopped and picked her up. During the ride she noticed that the driver was staring hard at her.<br />
<br />
When she asked him why, he said, &#8220;I want to ask you something, but I don&#8217;t want to offend you.&#8221;<br />
<br />
She said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t offend me. I have been a nun long enough that I have heard just about everything.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The cab driver then said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve always had the fantasy of having a nun give me a blow job.&#8221;<br />
<br />
She said, &#8220;Well, perhaps we can work something out under two conditions. First, you have to be single, and second you have to be Catholic.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Immediately the cab driver said, &#8220;Oh, yes! I&#8217;m single and I&#8217;m Catholic!&#8221;<br />
<br />
The nun said, &#8220;Okay, pull into that alleyway over there.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The cab driver pulled into the alleyway and the nun went to it. Soon after the nun was finished, the cab driver started crying.<br />
<br />
The nun said, &#8220;My child, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;<br />
<br />
He said tearfully, &#8220;Sister, I have sinned. I lied, I lied&#8230;I&#8217;m married and I&#8217;m Jewish!&#8221;<br />
<br />
The nun replied, &#8220;That&#8217;s okay. My name&#8217;s Jeff and I&#8217;m on my way to a costume party!&#8221;<br />

After dinner, one thing leads to another and they end up in her hotel bedroom. Just as things get hot, the female doc interrupts and says she has to go and wash her hands. Once she comes back they go for it. After the sex session, she gets up and says she is going to wash her hands.<br />
<br />
As she comes back the male doc says &#8220;I bet you are a surgeon.&#8221; She confirms and asks how he knew. &#8220;Easy, you&#8217;re always washing your hands.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s very clever&#8221; she says, &#8220;I bet you&#8217;re an anesthesiologist&#8221;. &#8220;Wow, how did you guess?&#8221;<br />

So he walked over to the bushes and propped his gun against a tree. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind blew and knocked his gun over, discharging it and shooting him in the genitals.<br />
<br />
Duck HuntAwaking several hours later in a hospital bed, our duck hunter is approached by his doctor. &#8220;Sir,&#8221; the doc begins &#8220;I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is there&#8217;s no internal damage, and we were able to remove all of the buckshot.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s great!&#8221; replied the hunter. &#8220;So what&#8217;s the bad news?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;The bad news is that there was some pretty extensive buckshot damage done to your penis. I&#8217;m going to have to refer you to my sister.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Oh, well that&#8217;s not so bad I guess,&#8221; the hunter replied. &#8220;Is your sister a plastic surgeon?&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Not exactly.&#8221; answered the doctor. &#8220;She&#8217;s a flute player in the local symphony, and she&#8217;s gonna to teach you where to put your fingers so you don&#8217;t pee in your eye.&#8221;<br />

This was by far the funniest one ^.^<br />
<br />
George W. Bush was visiting an elementary school, and the 4th grade class he sat through began a discussion related to words and their meanings.<br />
<br />
The teacher asked the President if he would like to lead the class in a discussion of the word &#8220;tragedy.&#8221; So, George W. asked the class for an example of a tragedy.<br />
<br />
One boy stood up and said, &#8220;If my best friend who lives next door is playing in the street and a car comes along and runs him over, that would be a tragedy.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bush, &#8220;that would be an accident.&#8221;<br />
<br />
A girl raised her hand and said, &#8220;If a school bus carrying 50 children drove off a cliff, killing everyone on board, that would be a tragedy.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; the President said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we would call a Great Loss.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The room went silent. No other children volunteered. President Bush searched the room and asked, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Finally, way in the back of the room, Johnny raised his hand, and in a quiet voice, he said, &#8220;If Air Force One, carrying Mr. and Mrs. Bush, was struck by a missile and blown up to smithereens, THAT would be a tragedy.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s right! And can you tell me WHY that would be a tragedy?&#8221; asked the President.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well,&#8221; Johnny said, &#8220;because it wouldn&#8217;t be an accident and it sure as hell wouldn&#8217;t be a Great Loss&#8230;&#8221;</div></div><hr />

One day the teacher walked to the back of the room where Johnny was, and he had his hand down his pants.<br />

Then, Johnny said, &#8220;It hurts down there.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well then, you need to go to the nurse and see if you can go home&#8221;, said the teacher.<br />
<br />
A little while later, Johnny came back to classroom and sat back down.<br />
<br />
Then the teacher came to the back of the room again, and he had his dick haging out of his pants.<br />
<br />
The teacher said, &#8220;Johnny, what&#8217;s that doing hanging out of your pants?!&#8221;<br />

A professor of chemistry wanted to teach his 5th grade class a lesson about the evils of liquor, so he produced an experiment that involved a glass of water, a glass of whiskey, and two worms. &#8220;Now, class. Observe closely the worms,&#8221; said the professor first putting a worm into the water. The worm in the water writhed about, happy as a worm in water could be. The second worm, he put into the whiskey. It writhed painfully, and it quickly sank to the bottom, dead as a doornail. &#8220;Now, what lesson can we derive from this experiment?&#8221; the professor asked.<br />
<br />
Little Johnny raised his hand and wisely responded, &#8220;Drink whiskey and you won&#8217;t get worms!&#8221;<br />

Little Johnny hears the word whorehouse in school and asks his father what it means. His father is quite shocked, and replies, Well, uh, you go there to, uh, have a good time.<br />

Saturday night rolls around. Johnny&#8217;s dad and a few of his friends head out to Mable&#8217;s (Liquor In The Front, Poker In The Rear! &#8212; Our Customers Come First!) for a good time.<br />

<br />
I&#8217;m here to have a good time!, Johnny Says<br />
<br />
The madame is a little puzzled, but, being a kind-hearted soul, invites Little Johnny inside. She gives him three donuts and then bids him goodbye.<br />
<br />
When he gets home, his dad is frantic. (Dad obviously had come and gone at Mabel&#8217;s.) Where have you been?<br />

I went to a WHOREHOUSE! Johnny proudly boasted!<br />

Little Johnny and Suzie were walking home from school after their first sex education class, when Suzie said that one thing she didn&#8217;t understand about it all was, &#8220;What is a penis?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Little Johnny said he didn&#8217;t know either, but would ask his father that night, because his father &#8220;Knew everything.&#8221; That night, when Johnny&#8217;s father came home from work, Little Johnny asked, &#8220;Dad, what&#8217;s a penis?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Johnny&#8217;s father led him into the bedroom, where Johnny&#8217;s father dropped his trousers, pointed down, and said, &#8220;That, Johnny, is a penis.&#8221; He then looked down at it and added, &#8220;In fact, that&#8217;s what I would call a PERFECT penis!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Little Johnny was impressed, thanked his father for explaining it, and ran out to play. The next morning, Little Johnny and Suzie were walking to school when Johnny proudly announced that he knew what a penis is. Suzie wanted to know, so Johnny led her around behind a bush, dropped his trousers, pointed down, and announced, &#8220;That, Suzie, is a penis.&#8221; He looked down at it and added, &#8220;In fact, if it was just 3 inches shorter, it would be a PERFECT penis!!!</div></div><hr />

A man walked into a bar room one day. He walked up to the bartender and said, &#8220;Bartender, I&#8217;d like to buy the house a round of drinks&#8221;. The bartender said, &#8220;No problem sir, but I&#8217;ll need to see some money first&#8221;. The guy pulls out a huge wad of bills and sets them on the bar. Well, the bartender can&#8217;t believe what he&#8217;s seeing. &#8220;Where did you get all that money?&#8221;, asked the bartender. &#8220;I&#8217;m a professional gambler&#8221;, replied the man. The bartender said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing! I mean, your odds are 50-50 at best, right?&#8221;. &#8220;Well, I only bet on sure things&#8221; said the guy.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Like what?&#8221; asked the bartender. &#8220;Well, for example, I&#8217;ll bet you $50 that I can bite my right eye.&#8221; The bartender thought about it. &#8220;OK&#8221;. So, the guy pulls out his false right eye and bites it. &#8220;Aw, you screwed me&#8221;, said the bartender, and paid the guy his $50. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you another chance. I&#8217;ll bet you another $50 that I can bite my LEFT eye&#8221; said the stranger. The bartender thought again and said, &#8220;Well, I know you&#8217;re not blind, I mean I watched you walk in here. I&#8217;ll take that bet&#8221;. So, the guy pulls out his false teeth and bites his left eye. &#8220;Aw, you screwed me again&#8221;. &#8220;That&#8217;s how I win so much money, bartender. I&#8217;ll just take a bottle of your best scotch in leiu of the $100&#8243;, said the man.<br />
<br />
With that, the guy went to the back room and spent the better part of the night playing cards with some of the locals. After many hours of drinking and card playing, he stumbled up to the bar. The guy, drunk as a skunk, said, &#8220;Bartender, I&#8217;ll give you one last chance. I&#8217;ll bet you $500 that I can stand on this bar here on one foot and piss into that whiskey bottle on that shelf behind you without spilling a drop&#8221;.<br />
<br />
The bartender once again pondered the bet. The guy couldn&#8217;t even stand up straight on two feet, much less one. &#8220;OK, you&#8217;re on&#8221;. The guy climbed up on the bar, stood on one leg, and began pissing all over the place. He hit the bar, the bartender, himself, but not a drop made it into the whiskey bottle.<br />
<br />
The bartender was ecstatic. Laughing, the bartender said, &#8220;Hey pal, you owe me $500!&#8221;. The guy climbed down off the bar and said, &#8220;That&#8217;s OK. I just bet each of the guys in the poker room $1000 that I could piss all over you AND the bar AND still make you laugh!&#8221;.<br />

The first bat said, &quot;See that castle over there? I drank the blood of three people.&quot; The second bat goes out on his night and comes back with blood around his mouth. The other two bats are astonished and ask how many people's blood had he drunk. The bat said, &quot;See that castle over there. I drank the blood of five people.&quot;<br />

The third bat goes out on his night and comes back covered in blood. This was totally amazing to the other two bats. They ask how much blood he drank. The 3rd bat said, &quot;See that castle over there?&quot; and the other bats nod. &quot;Well,&quot; says the third bat, &quot;I didn't.&quot; <br />

No one ever wanted to sleep with him, so he decided to drive around in his limo until he found somebody. Soon, he spotted a passed-out bum on the street. He quickly ran out, screwed the bum in the ass, left him fifty bucks, and drove off.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, the bum woke up, found the fifty bucks, bought a six-pack of Molson, drank them all, and passed out again.<br />
<br />
The next day, the rich man returned, found the bum again passed out, screwed him in the ass, and left him a hundred bucks. Astonished by the money when he woke up, the bum bought two six-packs, drank them down, and passed out again.<br />
<br />
The next day, the rich man did the same thing to the bum, but this time left him a hundred fifty bucks. When the bum woke up, he went to the store and bought a six-pack of Labatt's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Labatt's?&quot; asked the store clerk. &quot;You always buy Molson.&quot;<br />

  	A husband and wife had four boys. The odd part of it was that the older three had red hair, light skin, and were tall, while the youngest son had black hair, dark eyes, and was short.<br />
<br />
The father eventually took ill and was lying on his deathbed when he turned to his wife and said, &quot;Honey, before I die, be totally honest with me - is our youngest son my child?&quot;<br />
<br />
The wife replied, &quot;I swear on everything that's holy that he is your son.&quot;<br />

A guy sees a sign outside a bar that says &quot;Piano Player Wanted,&quot; so he goes in to apply. The bartender, who is desperate for a player, asks the man to play him something. The man sits down and plays some of the most beautiful music the bartender's ever heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing&quot; exclaims the bartender. &quot;What was that called?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was something I like to call 'A Weasel Ate My Genitals.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. You know anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy plays another amazingly gorgeous piece. Impressed, the bartender applauds and asks what that one was called.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's called 'Crap In My Mouth, I Love It.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; says the bartender. &quot;You can have the job. Just as long as you don't tell anyone the names of the songs.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the guy begins working nights at the bar, playing to full houses every night, and, true to his word, never revealing the titles of the songs. One night, though, he takes a break to go to the bathroom and forgets to zip up his pants afterwards and his schlong is hanging out. A patron notices and approaches him.<br />

An old man and women owned a farm. The old man died and the woman couldn't handle the farm by herself so she was going to hire someone to help her. The only job applicants were the town drunk and a new guy in town, who was gay. So she chose the gay guy; they worked together for a week or so and got the farm back together.<br />
<br />
The old woman was pleased with the work and worn out, so she decided to give herself and her hired hand the night off. Both went out to dinner, she with her friends and he with his. But when the old woman got home, he wasn't there. When he finally came in, she told him, “I'm your boss so you have to do what I tell you.”<br />
<br />
The gay guy said, “Okay.”<br />
<br />
So she said, “Take my shoes off,” so he did.<br />
<br />
She said, “Take my stockings off,” so he did.<br />
<br />
Then she said, “Take my dress off,” and he did.<br />
<br />
She said, “Take my bra off,” so he did.<br />
<br />
Then she said, “Take my panties off,” so he did.<br />
<br />
Finally, she said, “You leave this house wearing my clothes one more time and you're fired.” <br />
----New Joke---<br />
A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl tells him that after dinner, she would like to have sex with him for the first time. <br />
<br />
The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacy to get some condoms. The pharmacist helps the boy for about half an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy a 3-pack, 10-pack or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all. <br />
<br />
That night, the boy shows up at the girls parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. &quot;Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents! Come on in!&quot; The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. <br />
<br />
A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, &quot;I had no idea you were this religious.&quot; <br />
<br />
The boy turns, and whispers back, &quot;I had no idea your father was a pharmacist!&quot;<br />

A 90-year-old man said to his doctor, &quot;I've never felt better. I have an 18-year old bride who is pregnant with my child. What do you think about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor considered his question for a minute and then said, &quot;I have an elderly friend who is a hunter and never misses a season. One day when he was going out in a bit of a hurry, he accidentally picked up his umbrella instead of his gun. When he got to the Creek, he saw a rabbit sitting beside the stream. He raised his umbrella and went, 'bang, bang' and the rabbit fell dead. What do you think of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The 90-year-old said, &quot;I'd say somebody else killed that rabbit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor replied, &quot;My point exactly.&quot;<br />
---New Joke---Three guys are in a strip club. One guy walks over to a stripper, licks a 50 dollar bill and sticks it to one side of her butt.<br />
<br />
The next guy doesn't want to be shown up so he takes a 100 dollar bill, licks it, and sticks it to the other side of her butt.<br />
<br />
The third guy doesn't want to be shown up but he doesn't have any money. He thinks for a moment and suddenly he gets an idea. He walks over to the stripper, takes out his ATM card, slides it down the crack of her ass, takes his 150 dollars and goes home!<br />

A man is opening a restaurant and he asks one of his workers to come up with a name for it.<br />
<br />
The man tells Al, one of his workers, that he will name the resaurant after the first thing Al sees when he goes out the door.<br />
<br />
Al walks outside and the first thing he saw was a girl named Lucy and he saw her legs. He told the man, and so the restaurant was named Lucy's Legs. The man was so impressed that he said the next day Al could get a free drink.<br />
<br />
The next day Al comes a bit early and a policeman walks by and notices Al waiting there. The policeman asks, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Al says, &quot;I'm waiting for Lucy's legs to open so I can get a drink.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seisuke</div><div class="date">09-14-2009, 19:46</div></div><div class="posttext">A first-grade teacher, Ms. Brooks, was having trouble with one of her students.<br />
<br />
The teacher asked, &quot;Harry, what's your problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry answered, &quot;I'm too smart for the 1st grade. My sister is in the 3rd grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the 3rd grade too!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks had had enough. She took Harry to the principal's office. While Harry waited in the outer office, the teacher explained to the principal what the situation was. The principal told Ms. Brooks he would give the boy a test. If he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the 1st grade and behave. She agreed.<br />
<br />
Harry was brought in and the conditions were explained to him and he agreed to take the test.<br />
<br />
Principal: &quot;What is 3 x 3?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry: &quot;9&quot;.<br />
<br />
Principal: &quot;What is 6 x 6?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry: &quot;36&quot;.<br />
<br />
And so it went with every question the principal thought a 3rd grader should know.<br />
<br />
The principal looks at Ms. Brooks and tells her, &quot;I think Harry can go to the 3rd grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks says to the principal, &quot;Let me ask him some questions.&quot; The principal and Harry both agreed.<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks asks, &quot;What does a cow have four of that I have only two of?&quot; Harry, after a moment: &quot;Legs.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks: &quot;What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?&quot; The principal wondered, why would she ask such a question! Harry replied: &quot;Pockets.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks: &quot;What does a dog do that a man steps into?&quot; Harry: &quot;Pants&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks: What's starts with a C, ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin, whitish liquid?<br />
<br />
Harry: &quot;Coconut.&quot;<br />
<br />
The principal sat forward with his mouth hanging open.<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks: &quot;What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?&quot; The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer.<br />
<br />
Harry: &quot;Bubble gum&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks: &quot;What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry: &quot;Shake hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
The principal was trembling.<br />
<br />
Ms. Brooks: &quot;What word starts with an 'F' and ends in 'K' that means a lot of heat and excitement?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry: &quot;Firetruck&quot;<br />
<br />
The principal breathed a sigh of relief and told the teacher, &quot;Put Harry in the fifth-grade, I got the last seven questions wrong......<br />

A man is driving down the road and notices a car in the ditch. He doesn't usually help many people so he drives on by. Then he notices that a pretty woman is the driver so he goes back to help.<br />
<br />
As he is hooking his truck to her car he says, &#8220;You know, you are the first pregnant woman I've ever helped out of a ditch.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;But I'm not pregnant,&#8221; she says.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Well, you're not out of the ditch yet,&#8221; he says. <br />

One night two drunks were wandering the town trying to get drinks, but between the two of them, they only had a dollar and change. So the first drunk says, &quot;Hey, I've got an idea - we put our money together and buy a hot dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second drunk, looking at him puzzled, says, &quot;What the hell? I don't want a hot dog; I want a goddamn drink!&quot;<br />
<br />
The first says, &quot;I know. We buy the hot dog, stick it down the front of my pants, go into a bar and order our drinks. When the bartender tells us the price, you drop to your knees and suck the hot dog like you're sucking my dick - and the bartender will throw us out and we won't have to pay for anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
The second drunk says, &quot;Well, it sounds like a good enough idea to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
So they buy the hot dog and the first drunk sticks it down his pants. They go into a bar, order two whiskeys, and when the bartender tells them the price, the second drunk drops to his knees and sucks on the hot dog. The bartender throws them out and tells them not to come back.<br />
<br />
The drunks go on to hit 19 bars. Finally, the second drunk says, &quot;We've got to switch places 'cause my knees hurt from dropping to the floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
The first drunk says, &quot;You think that's bad? I lost the hot dog in the third bar!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guy says, &quot;No no no, it's a tame alligator. I'll prove it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
He picks up the alligator and puts it on the bar. Then he unzips his pants, pulls out his package and sticks it in the alligator's mouth. The alligator just keeps his mouth open. After about 5 minutes, he pulls it out of the alligator's mouth and zips up his pants and says, &quot;See, I told you it was a tame alligator. Anybody else want to try it?&quot;<br />
<br />
The drunk down at the end of the bar says, &quot;Yah, I'd like to try it but I don't think I can hold my mouth open that long!&quot;<br />

So the farmer takes him home and says, &quot;It's your first day so take it slow, okay?&quot;<br />

A woman was trying to do her laundry one day, when her washing machine suddenly broke down. Distraught, she called her husband at the office and said, &quot;Honey, can you please come home and fix the washing machine? It doesn't work.&quot; The angry husband replied, &quot;What do I look like? The freakin? Maytag man?&quot; and hung up. The woman decided to go to the Laundromat to complete her washing. She got in the car, but when she turned the key in the ignition, it wouldn't start.<br />
<br />
She again called her husband at work and said, &quot;Honey, I tried to go to the Laundromat with the car, but it wouldn't start. Can you come home and take a look at it?&quot; Again, the angry husband snaps, &quot;What do I look like? Freakin? Mr. Goodwrench?&quot; and hung up. She decided that the best thing to do is call the Maytag man. The Maytag man arrived and fixed the washing machine. She then asked him if he knows anything about fixing cars. He replied that he knows a little and goes outside and takes a look under the hood.<br />
<br />
Ten minutes later, he returned and said, &quot;Your car is running fine now. The only thing wrong was your fuel filter was a little dirty.&quot; The lady said, &quot;Wow, you're a pretty handy guy! How much will this all cost?&quot; The Maytag man says, &quot;I?ll tell ya what, lady. You can bake me a cake or have sex with me - your choice.&quot; Later that evening, the husband returned home from work. The lady explained to her husband that the Maytag man fixed the washing machine and the car. The husband asked how much all of this will cost. She replied that he wanted me to bake a cake for him or have sex. The husband then said &quot;Well, what kind of cake did you bake for him?&quot; The lady said, &quot;What do I look like? Freakin? Betty Crocker?&quot;</div></div><hr />

A married man was having an affair with his secretary. One day, their passions overcame them and they took off for her house, where they made passionate love all afternoon. Exhausted from the wild sex, they fell asleep and awoke at around 8 p.m. As the man threw on his clothes, he told the woman to take his shoes outside and rub them through the grass and dirt. Mystified, she nonetheless complied and he slipped into his shoes and drove home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; demanded his wife when he entered the house.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Darling,&quot; replied the man, &quot;I can't lie to you. I've been having an affair with my secretary and we've been having sex all afternoon. I fell asleep and didn't wake up until eight o'clock.&quot;<br />

One night, a father passed by his son's room and heard his son praying: &quot;God bless Mommy, Daddy, and Grandma. Ta ta, Grandpa.&quot;<br />
<br />
The father didn't quite know what this meant, but was glad his son was praying. The next morning, they found Grandpa dead on the floor of a heart attack. The father reassured himself that it was just a coincidence, but was still a bit spooked.<br />
<br />
The next night, he heard his son praying again: &quot;God bless Mommy and Daddy. Ta ta, Grandma.&quot;<br />
<br />
The father was worried, but decided to wait until morning. Sure enough, the next morning Grandma was on the floor, dead of a heart attack.<br />
<br />
Really scared now, the father decided to wait outside his son's door the next night. And sure enough, the boy started to pray: &quot;God bless Mommy. Ta ta, Daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the father was crapping his pants. He stayed up all night, and went to the doctor's early the next day to make sure his health was fine. When he finally came home, his wife was waiting on the porch. She said, &quot;Thank God you're here -- we could really use your help! We found milkman dead on our porch this morning!&quot; <br />

---------------------------<br />
A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his 5-year old son waiting for him at the door.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, may I ask you a question?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'Yeah sure, what it is?' replied the man.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, how much do you make an hour?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?' the man said angrily.<br />
<br />
SON: 'I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'If you must know, I make $50 an hour.'<br />
<br />
SON: 'Oh,' the little boy replied, with his head down.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, may I please borrow $25?'<br />
<br />
The father was furious, 'If the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you are being so selfish. I don't work hard everyday for such childish frivolities. '<br />
<br />
The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door.<br />
<br />
The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy's questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money?<br />
<br />
After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down , and started to think:<br />
<br />
Maybe there was something he really needed to buy with that $25.00 and he really didn't ask for money very often The man went to the door of the little boy's room and opened the door.<br />
<br />
'Are you asleep, son?' He asked.<br />
<br />
'No daddy, I'm awake,' replied the boy.<br />
<br />
'I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier' said the man. 'It's been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the $25 you asked for.'<br />
<br />
The little boy sat straight up, smiling. 'Oh, thank you daddy!' he yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills.<br />
<br />
The man saw that the boy already had money, started to get angry again.<br />
<br />
The little boy slowly counted out his money, and then looked up at his father.<br />
<br />
'Why do you want more money if you already have some?' the father grumbled.<br />
<br />
'Because I didn't have enough, but now I do,' the little boy replied.<br />
<br />
'Daddy, I have $50 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you.'<br />
<br />
The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little son, and he begged for his forgiveness. <br />

While a man was polishing his new car, his 4 years old son picked up a stone and scratch lines on the side of the car.<br />
<br />
<br />
In anger, the man took the child's hand and hit it many times; not realizing he was using a wrench. At the hospital, the child lost all his fingers due to multiple fractures. +<br />
<br />
<br />
When the child saw his father.....with painful eyes he asked, 'Dad when will my fingers grow back?'<br />
<br />

The man was so hurt and speechless; he went back to his car and kicked it a lot of times.  Devastated by his own actions...sitting in front of the car he looked at the scratches; the child had written 'LOVE YOU DAD'.<br />

 A couple was getting ready to go to a Halloween party but the wife had a terrible headache. She told her husband to go anyway. After a short argument he agreed, and she took some aspirin and went to bed.<br />
<br />
Later she awoke and felt great, so she decided to go to the party and see what her hubby did when she wasn't around. As soon as she arrived, she noticed him on the dance floor getting very friendly with every hottie in the place, and groping them when he could.<br />
<br />
She then cut in and rubbed close to him. When the song ended, he leaned over and whispered in her ear, &quot;Let's go outside.&quot; So the two costumed characters snuck off and occupied themselves in one of the parked cars.<br />
<br />
Midnight was to be the unveiling of the party-goers, so she slipped out and went home before the clock struck twelve.<br />

When he got home she asked, &quot;How was the party? Did you meet any interesting people?&quot;<br />

He replied, ''You know me, dear. I don't have a good time when you're not with me. I ran into a few friends and we ended up in the basement playing poker. It wasn't very fun at all. But the guy I loaned my costume to had the time of his life!&quot;</div></div><hr />

---New Joke---<br />
A city slicker went to the country to buy a pig. When he approached the pig farmer, he asked for a 25-pound pig. The pig farmer put the pig's tail in his mouth and bobbed his head up and down. He then told the city slicker that the pig was too heavy -- it was 30 pounds. The city slicker told the farmer he didn't believe that was the way to weigh pigs. The farmer called his son over and asked him to weigh the pig. The son put the pig's tail in his mouth, bobbed his head a couple of times and said the pig weighed 30 pounds. The city slicker said the farmer and his son were putting him on. The farmer told his son to go get his mother and have her come out and weigh the pig. The son went into the house and after a few minutes came out again.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom's weighing the mailman.&quot;<br />

This guy and his girlfriend were going at it hot and heavy in the backseat of his car. A knock was heard on the window and there stood a cop. The guy got out, shaking like a leaf. The cop said that he wouldn't arrest him if he could be next.<br />
<br />
The guy got back in the car and finished with his girlfriend. When he got out again, he was still shaking like a leaf. The cop said there was no reason to be scared, because he wouldn't arrest him if he could be next. The guy said 'I'm not afraid that you'll arrest me, it's just that I've never done it with a cop before!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seisuke</div><div class="date">09-20-2009, 18:11</div></div><div class="posttext">Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven.<br />
<br />
At the Gates, St. Peter greets Ford, and tells him, &quot;Well,<br />
you've been such a good guy, and your invention...the assembly<br />
line for the automobile...changed the world. As a reward, you<br />
can hang out with anyone in Heaven you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ford thinks about it, and says, - &quot;I want to hang out with God<br />
Himself.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, the befuddled St. Peter takes Ford to the Throne Room,and<br />
introduces him to God. Ford then asks God, &quot;When you invented<br />
Woman, what were You thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
God asks, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Well,&quot; says Ford, &quot;You have some<br />
major design flaws in your invention.<br />
<br />
1. There's too much front end protrusion. 2. It chatters way too<br />
much at high speeds. 3. Maintenance is extremely high. 4. It<br />
constantly needs repainting, and refinishing. 5. It is out of<br />
commission at least 5 or 6 days of every 28 6. The rear end<br />
wobbles too much. 7. The intake is placed too close to the<br />
exhaust. 8. The headlights are usually too small. 9. Fuel<br />
consumption is outrageous.<br />
<br />
And that's just to name a few.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...,&quot; replies God, &quot;Hold on a minute.&quot; God goes over to the<br />
Celestial Supercomputer, types in a few keystrokes, and waits<br />
for the results. In no time the computer prints out a report,<br />
and God reads it.<br />
<br />
God then turns to Ford, and says, &quot;It may be that my design is<br />
flawed, but according to these statistics, more men are riding<br />
my invention than yours.&quot;<br />

Willie the Whale and his whale girlfriend, Monica, are swimming happily through the ocean when they come upon a boat. On seeing the boat, Willie says, &quot;Hey, I've got a great idea! Let's swim up under that boat and blow out really hard through our blowholes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica says, &quot;Oh, I don't know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, it'll be fun, come on, just this once!&quot;, says Willie.<br />
<br />
Monica agrees and they swim up under the boat and blow out, capsizing the boat and sending hapless sailors into the briny blue.<br />
<br />
As they are swimming away, Willie says, &quot;Wow, that was fun, wasn't it? Hey! I've got another idea! Let's swim back there and eat all the sailors!&quot;<br />
<br />
To which Monica, exasperated, replies, &quot;Look, I agreed to the blow job, but I'm not swallowing any seamen.&quot;<br />
---New Joke---<br />
A new primary school teacher starts her first day of class. She begins by asking students to stand and introduce themselves<br />
<br />
The first child stands and says, &quot;My name is Mary Johnson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Mary&quot;, says the teacher.<br />
<br />
The second student says, &quot;My name is Sam Smith.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
The third student says, &quot;My name is Johnny Fuckhour.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teacher is horrified, and tells Johnny that this type of language will not be allowed. He replies, &quot;Honest, my name is Johnny Fuckhour. If you don't believe me, check up in the fifth grade where my brother is.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the teacher walks up to the fifth grade class, and asks, &quot;Do you have a Fuckhour in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
One boy stands in the back of the room and says, &quot;Hell, no! We don't even get a nap hour in here!&quot;</div></div><hr />

A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his 5-year old son waiting for him at the door.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, may I ask you a question?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'Yeah sure, what it is?' replied the man.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, how much do you make an hour?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?' the man said angrily.<br />
<br />
SON: 'I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'If you must know, I make $50 an hour.'<br />
<br />
SON: 'Oh,' the little boy replied, with his head down.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, may I please borrow $25?'<br />
<br />
The father was furious, 'If the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you are being so selfish. I don't work hard everyday for such childish frivolities. '<br />
<br />
The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door.<br />
<br />
The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy's questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money?<br />
<br />
After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down , and started to think:<br />
<br />
Maybe there was something he really needed to buy with that $25.00 and he really didn't ask for money very often The man went to the door of the little boy's room and opened the door.<br />
<br />
'Are you asleep, son?' He asked.<br />
<br />
'No daddy, I'm awake,' replied the boy.<br />
<br />
'I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier' said the man. 'It's been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the $25 you asked for.'<br />
<br />
The little boy sat straight up, smiling. 'Oh, thank you daddy!' he yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills.<br />
<br />
The man saw that the boy already had money, started to get angry again.<br />
<br />
The little boy slowly counted out his money, and then looked up at his father.<br />
<br />
'Why do you want more money if you already have some?' the father grumbled.<br />
<br />
'Because I didn't have enough, but now I do,' the little boy replied.<br />
<br />
'Daddy, I have $50 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you.'<br />

The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little son, and he begged for his forgiveness. <br />

A boy was walking down the road when he noticed an old geezer with an unusually small head. The curious boy walked up to the geezer and said, “Hey mister! Why the hell is your head so small?”<br />
<br />
The old man looked at the boy and replied, “Boy, if I wasn’t so damn old, I’d give you a beating… but since you remind me of myself at your age, I’ll tell you.”<br />
<br />
The boy listened curiously as the geezer explained, “One day I was fishing on the pier when I got a huge bite… And, I said to myself, ‘Holy shit! I’ve caught a whale!’”<br />
<br />
“No kidding?” pried the boy. The geezer continued, “But, when I reeled it up, to my surprise, it was a gorgeous mermaid! Well, she looked at me in tremendous fright and said she’d grant me one wish if I let her free…”<br />
<br />
“And?” interjected the boy. “Well, after some quick thought, I looked at her and said, ‘How about a little head?’”<br />

A family is sitting around the supper table. The son asks his father, “Dad, how many kinds of breasts are there?<br />
<br />
The father, surprised, answers, “Well, son, there are three kinds of breasts. In her twenties, a woman’s breasts are like melons, round and firm. In her thirties to forties, they are like pears, still nice but hanging a bit. After fifty, they are like onions.”<br />
<br />
“Onions?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, you see them and they make you cry.”<br />
<br />
This infuriated the wife and daughter. So the daughter said ” Mom, how many kinds of penises are there?”<br />
<br />
The mother, surprised, smiles and looks at her daughter and answers, “Well dear, a man goes through three phases. In a man’s twenties, his penis is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his thirties and forties, it is a birch, flexible but reliable. After his fifties, it is like a Christmas tree.”<br />
<br />
“A Christmas tree?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, dead from the root up and the balls are for decoration only!”<br />

Just imagine sitting in traffic on your way to work and hearing this. Many Sydney folks did hear this on the FOX FM morning show in Sydney. The DJs play a game where they award winners great prizes. The game is called “Mate Match“.<br />
<br />
The DJs call someone at work and ask if they are married or seriously involved with someone. If the contestant answers “yes”, he or she is then asked 3 random yet highly personal questions. The person is also asked to divulge the name of their partner with phone number for verification. If their partner answers those same three questions correctly, they both win the prize.<br />
<br />
One particular game, however, several months ago made the Harbour City drop to its knees with laughter and is possibly the funniest thing you’ve heard yet. Anyway, here’s how it all went down:<br />
<br />
DJ: “Hey! This is Ed on FOX-FM. Have you ever heard of ‘Mate Match’?”<br />
<br />
Contestant: (laughing) “Yes, I have.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Great! Then you know we’re giving away a trip to the Gold Coast if you win. What is your name? First only please.”<br />
<br />
Contestant: “Brian.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Brian, are you married or what?”<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing nervously) “Yes, I am married.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Thank you. Now, what is your wife’s name? First only please.”<br />
<br />
Brian: “Sara.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Is Sara at work, Brian?”<br />
<br />
Brian: “She is gonna kill me.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Stay with me here, Brian! Is she at work?”<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing) “Yes, she’s at work.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Okay, first question - when was the last time you had sex?”<br />
<br />
Brian: “About 8 o’clock this morning.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Atta boy, Brian.”<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing sheepishly) “Well…”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Question #2 - How long did it last?”<br />
<br />
Brian: “About 10 minutes.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Wow! You really want that trip, huh? No one would ever have said that if a trip wasn’t at stake.”<br />
<br />
Brian: “Yeah, that trip sure would be nice.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Okay. Final question. Where did you have sex at 8 o’clock<br />
this morning?<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing hard) “I, ummm, I, well…”<br />
<br />
DJ: “This sounds good, Brian. Where was it at?”<br />
<br />
Brian: “Not that it was all that great, but her mum is staying with us for a couple of weeks…”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Uh huh…”<br />
<br />
Brian: “…and the Mother-In-Law was in the shower at the time.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Atta boy, Brian.”<br />
<br />
Brian: “On the kitchen table.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Not that great?? That is more adventure than the previous hundred times I’ve done it. Okay folks, I will put Brian on hold, get this wife’s work number and call her up. You listen to this.”<br />
<br />
[3 minutes of commercials follow.]<br />
<br />
DJ: “Okay audience; let’s call Sarah, shall we?” (Touch tones…..ringing….)<br />
<br />
Clerk: “Kinkos.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Hey, is Sarah around there somewhere?”<br />
<br />
Clerk: “This is she.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Sarah, this is Ed with FOX-FM. We are live on the air right now and I’ve been talking with Brian for a couple of hours now.”<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) “A couple of hours?”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Well, a while now. He is on the line with us. Brian knows not to give any answers away or you’ll lose. Sooooooo… do you know the rules of ‘Mate Match’?”<br />
<br />
Sarah: “No.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Good!”<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing)<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) “Brian, what the hell are you up to?”<br />
<br />
Brian: (laughing) “Just answer his questions honestly, okay? Be completely honest.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Yeah yeah yeah. Sure. Now, I will ask you 3 questions, Sarah. If your answers match Brian’s answers, then the both of you will be off to the Gold Coast for 5 days on us.”<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) “Yes.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Alright. When did you last have sex, Sarah?”<br />
<br />
Sarah: “Oh God, Brian….uh, this morning before Brian went to work.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “What time?”<br />
<br />
Sarah: “Around 8 this morning.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Very good. Next question. How long did it last?”<br />
<br />
Sarah: “12, 15 minutes maybe.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Hmmmm. That’s close enough. I am sure she is trying to protect his manhood. We’ve got one last question, Sarah. You are one question away from a trip to the Gold Coast. Are you ready?”<br />
<br />
Sarah: (laughing) “Yes.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “Where did you have it?”<br />
<br />
Sarah: “OH MY GOD, BRIAN!! You didn’t tell them that did you?”<br />
<br />
Brian: “Just tell him, honey.”<br />
<br />
DJ: “What is bothering you so much, Sarah?”<br />
<br />
Sarah: “Well…”<br />
<br />
DJ: Come on Sarah…..where did you have it?<br />
<br />
Sarah: “Up the a$$…”<br />
<br />
After a long pause, the DJ said, “Folks, we need to take a station break”<br />
<br />
And the drivers of Sydney almost crashed their cars laughing!<br />

-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
An old couple were sitting in their living room on a Sunday morning watching a religious program.<br />
<br />
The preacher on this show would go to all the people in the audience and asking them what they wanted fixed, then he would have them cover the part of their body they wanted fixed.<br />
<br />
Many of the people were elderly so they were covering their eyes and hearts. Then the preacher said &quot;Ok now for you at home put your hand on the part of your body you want fixed and say this prayer with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
So the little old lady watching from home with her husband put her hand on her heart, because she had a very bad heart. And the little old man put his hands on his crotch.<br />
<br />
The little old lady turned to her husband and said &quot;He said he could heal the sick, not raise the dead!&quot; <br />
---New Joke---<br />
The modest young lass had just purchased some lingerie <br />
and asked if she might have the sentence, <br />
&quot;If you can read this you're too damn close&quot; embroidered on her panties and bra. <br />
 &quot;Yes Madame,&quot; said the clerk. &quot;I'm quite certain that could be done. Would you prefer block or script letters?&quot; <br />
&quot;Braille,&quot; she replied.<br />
---New Joke---<br />
One day when the teacher walked to the black board, she noticed someone had<br />
written the word 'penis' in tiny small letters. She turned around, scanned the<br />
class looking for the guilty face. Finding none, she quickly erased it, and<br />
began her class.<br />
The next day she went into the room and she saw, in larger letters, the word<br />
'penis' again on the black board. Again, she looked around in vain for the<br />
culprit, but found none, so she proceeded with the day's lesson.<br />
<br />
Every morning, for about a week, she went into the classroom and found the<br />
same word written on the board, and each day it was written in larger letters.<br />
<br />
Finally, one day, she walked in, expecting to be greeted by the same word on<br />
the board, but instead, found the words, &quot;The more you rub it, the bigger it<br />
gets!&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;If I do 250 kph, will you take off your clothes?&quot; he smirks. &quot;OK&quot; said his adventurous girlfriend. As he gets up to 250, she peels off all her clothes. Unable to keep his eyes on the road, the car skids on some gravel and flips over. The naked girl is thrown clear, but the boyfriend is jammed beneath the steering wheel.<br />
&quot;Go and get help!&quot; he cries.<br />
&quot;But I can't! I'm naked and my clothes are gone!&quot;<br />
&quot;Take my shoe&quot; he says &quot;and cover yourself.&quot;<br />

&quot;Please help me! My boyfriend's stuck!&quot;<br />

One day a guy dies and finds himself in hell. As he's wallowing in despair, he has his first meeting with a demon...<br />

Demon: Why so glum?<br />

I had three girlfriends, but wasn't sure which one to marry. So I decided to give each one $5000 and see how each of them spends it.<br />
<br />
The first one went out and gets a total makeover with the money. She gets new clothes, a new hairdo, manicure, pedicure, the works, and comes back to my place and says, &quot;I spent the money so I could look pretty for you because I love you so much.&quot; I was very touched and aroused, and we had lots of great sex.<br />
<br />
The second one went out and bought new golf clubs, a CD player, a television, and a stereo and brings them back to me as gifts. This sweet girl looked into my eyes and said, &quot;I bought these gifts for you with the money because I love you so much.&quot; I watched my new television with great enjoyment!<br />
<br />
The third one takes the $5000 and invested it in the stock market, doubled her investment, returns the original $5000 to me and reinvests the rest. She says, &quot;I am investing the rest of the money for our future because I love you so much.&quot; She has enough to buy me a new boat.<br />
<br />
I thought long and hard about how each of the women spent the money and decided to marry the one with the biggest tits.</div></div><hr />

After his checkup, the doctor called the wife into his office alone. He said, &quot;Your husband is suffering from a very severe stress disorder. If you don't do the following, your husband will surely die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast.  Be pleasant at all times. For lunch make him a nutritious meal.  For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him.  Don't burden him with chores.  Don't discuss your problems with him, it will only make his stress worse.   No nagging.  And most importantly, make love with your husband several times a week.  If you can do this for the next 10 months to a year, I think your husband will regain his health completely.&quot;<br />

They all say: &#8220;You've been screwing around in the Far East, very common there, no cure. We'll have to cut it off.&#8221; The man panics, but figures if it is common in the East they must know how to cure it. So he goes back and sees a doctor in Pakistan.<br />
<br />
The doctor examines him and says, &quot;You've been fooling around in my country. This is a very common problem here. Did you see any other doctors?&#8221;<br />
<br />
The man replies, &#8220;Yes a few in the USA.&#8221;<br />

When Apollo Mission Astronaut Neil Armstrong first walked on the moon, he not only gave his famous &quot;One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,&quot; statement but followed it up with several remarks to the other astronauts and Mission Control.<br />
<br />
Just before he re-entered the lander, however, he made the enigmatic remark, &quot;Good luck Mr. Gorsky.&quot;<br />
<br />
Many people at NASA thought it was a remark concerning some rival Soviet Cosmonaut.<br />
<br />
However, upon checking, there was no Gorsky in either the Russian or American space programs. Over the years, many people questioned Armstrong as to what the &quot;Good luck Mr. Gorsky&quot; statement meant, but Armstrong always just smiled.<br />
<br />
On July 5, 1995 in Tampa, Florida, while answering questions following a speech, a reporter brought up the 26-year-old question to Armstrong. This time he finally responded. Mr. Gorsky had finally died and so Neil Armstrong felt he could answer the question.<br />
<br />
Armstrong explained, &quot;When I was a kid, I was playing baseball with a friend in the backyard. My friend hit a fly ball that landed in the front of his neighbor's bedroom windows. My neighbors were Mr. &amp; Mrs. Gorsky. As I leaned down to pick up the ball, I heard Mrs. Gorsky shouting at Mr. Gorsky, &quot;Oral sex! You want oral sex?! You'll get oral sex when the kid next door walks on the moon!&quot;<br />

A newly married hillbilly couple decided they wanted children, but didn't know how to go about it. Questions and conversations with friends and relatives proved no help, until a neighbor said they should go to town and ask the Big City Doctor. The doctor let them look at a child's book about where babies came from, but to no avail. He tried his own explanation but was met with blank stares. Exasperated, he took them to his private office, and showed them a porno movie. This was also useless.

One day, a farmer was tending to his livestock when he noticed that one of his cows was completely cross-eyed. He called up a veterinarian friend of his who told him to bring in his cow. The vet took one look at the cow, stuck a tube up the cow's butt, and blew into the tube until the cow's eyes straightened out. The vet charged the farmer a hundred bucks, and the farmer went home happy. About a week later, the cow's eyes were cross-eyed again, but this time the farmer figured he could probably take care of it himself. So he called his hired hand over, and together they put a tube up the cow's butt. The farmer put his lips to the tube and started to blow. Strangely, nothing happened, so he asked his hired hand to give it a try. The hired hand removed the tube, turned it around, put it in the cow's butt and started to blow.<br />

&quot;Well, I wasn't gonna use the side that YOU had put your lips on.&quot;<br />

Police arrested Joe Bloggs, a 27-year old white male and resident of Wimbledon UK, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38pm Friday. Bloggs will be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication at the County courthouse on Monday. The suspect allegedly stated that after a night of drinking, as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he decided to stop.<br />

&quot;You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there wasn't,&quot; he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.

A couple of minutes later he says, &quot;If you have sex with me, I'll give you three hundred dollars.&quot; She thinks about it and agrees.<br />
<br />
After the sex, he leaves, saying he had other buisness to get to. She thinks happily about the six hundred dollars and what she would do with it. Her husband comes home and she says, &quot;Honey, your friend came over today.&quot;<br />
<br />
He replies, &quot;Oh? Did he have the six hundred dollars he owed me?&quot;<br />

Adam was talking to his friend at the bar, and he said, &quot;I don't know what to get my wife for her birthday - she has everything, and besides, she can afford to buy anything she wants, so I'm stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
His friend said, &quot;I have an idea! Why don't you make up a certificate saying she can have 60 minutes of great sex, any way she wants it. She'll probably be thrilled.&quot;<br />
Adam decided to to his friend's advice.<br />
<br />
The next day at the bar his friend said, &quot;Well? Did you take my suggestion?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I did,&quot; Adam replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes! she jumped up , thanked me, kissed me on the forehead and ran out the door, yelling &quot;I'll be back in an hour!!&quot;<br />

A man is lying in bed in a hospital with an oxygen mask over his mouth. A young nurse appears to sponge his face and hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nurse,&quot; he mumbles from behind the mask, &quot;Are my testicles black?&quot;<br />
<br />
Embarrassed the young nurse replies, &quot;I don't know, I''m only here to wash your face and hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
He struggles again to ask, &quot;Nurse, Are my testicles black?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again the nurse replies, &quot;I can''t tell. I''m only here to wash your face and hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ward nurse passes by and sees the man getting a little distraught so she marches over to inquire what is wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nurse,&quot; he mumbles, &quot;Are my testicles black?&quot;<br />
<br />
Being a nurse she is undaunted. She whips back the bedclothes, pulls down his pajama trousers, moves his penis out of the way, has a good look, pulls up the pajamas, replaces the bedclothes and announces, &quot;Nothing is wrong with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
At this the man pulls off his oxygen mask and asks again,<br />
<br />
&quot;Are my test results back?&quot;</div></div><hr />

An old man from a far off land was once on the subway in New York and he sat down next to a younger man.  He noticed that the young man had a strange kind of shirt collar.<br />
<br />
Having never seen a priest before, he asked the man, &quot;Excuse me sir, but why do you have your shirt collar on backwards?&quot;<br />
<br />
The priest became a bit flustered but politely answered, &quot;I wear this collar because I am a Father&quot;.<br />
<br />
The old man thought a second and responded, &quot;Sir I am also a Father but I wear my collar front-ways.   Why do you wear your collar so differently?&quot;<br />
<br />
The priest thought for a minute and said, &quot;Sir, I am the father for many.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man quickly answered, &quot;I too am the father of many.  I have four sons, four daughters and too many grandchildren to count.  But I wear my collar like everyone else does.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you wear it your way?&quot;<br />
<br />
The priest who was beginning to get exasperated thought and then blurted out, &quot;Sir, I am the father for hundreds and hundreds of people.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man from the far-away country was taken aback and was silent for a long time.<br />
<br />
As he got up to leave the subway train, he leaned over to the priest and said, &quot;Mister, maybe you should wear your pants backwards.&quot;<br />

There was a young woman who lived with her grandmother. One night, the granddaughter came bouncing down the stairs dressed to go out to a party wearing a see-through blouse without a bra. Her grandmother told her to go back upstairs and &quot;dress decent&quot;.<br />
<br />
''No, I want to show off my rosebuds!'' she said and bounded out the door. The next day, the granddaughter came outside to find her grandmother on the porch wearing a see-through blouse without a bra.<br />
<br />
''Grandmother! What are you doing? A couple of other friends are coming over any time now! Please go change your blouse, I'm so embarrassed!''<br />

''No. If you can show off them rosebuds then I can show off my hanging baskets.''<br />

After he takes his shirt off, he flexes his muscular arms and says, &quot;See that, baby? That's 1000 pounds of dynamite!&quot;  She begins to drool.<br />
<br />
The man drops his pants, strikes a bodybuilder's pose, and says, referring to his bulging thighs, &quot;See those, baby?  That's 1000 pounds of dynamite!&quot; She is aching for action at this point.<br />

  	A truck driver had a 2 day lay-over during the St. Patrick's Day holiday. He was getting bored with just sitting at the truck stop cafe, so he decided to go for a few beers. After about the 4th one, he had to use the bathroom badly. He went into the bathroom, and he was peeing, lhe ooked into the next stall and noticed a leprechaun whose penis was HUGE!<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me ask you something...how come short guys have bigger peckers than tall guys?&quot;<br />
<br />
In his heavy Irish accent, the leprechaun looked up and said, &quot;I don't know laddy, i'm a leprechaun&quot;.<br />
<br />
With that, the trucker reached out and grabbed him and said, &quot;Well guess what? I caught ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aye lad, that ya did, but your wishes won't come true until tomorrow morning&quot;.<br />
<br />
The trucker was confused by this, &quot;Why not? You're a leprechaun, I caught ya, so you are supposed to grant me 3 wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well&quot;, began the leprechaun, &quot;you don't know anything about us leprechauns. We get a day of the year off and it happens to be St. Patrick's Day.&quot; Well, the trucker understanding this made his 3 wishes. He wanted to own his trucking company, he wanted every woman he saw to desire his body and he wanted 10 million dollars in the bank, tax free. The leprechaun said it would be done in the morning. On his way out of the restroom, the leprechaun says, &quot;Lad, would you like to have your wishes come true tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah, but what's the catch?&quot;, came the reply. &quot;Well, you gotta let a leprechaun corn-hole ya.&quot; The trucker, at first protested, but then the leprechaun reminded him of all that he would be gaining in few precious moments. Thinking about the money, the company becoming his and ALL those women, he agreed but told the leprechaun not to tell anyone. When it was all over, the leprechaun was getting ready to leave, turned to the trucker and said, &quot;Laddy, can I ask ya a question?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure&quot;, says the trucker.<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are ya now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm 40 years old&quot; says the trucker.<br />
<br />
With that, the leprechaun says, &quot;You mean to tell me that you're 40 years old and still believe in leprechauns?&quot;</div></div><hr />

---------------------------<br />
A man came home from work late, tired and irritated, to find his 5-year old son waiting for him at the door.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, may I ask you a question?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'Yeah sure, what it is?' replied the man.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, how much do you make an hour?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'That's none of your business. Why do you ask such a thing?' the man said angrily.<br />
<br />
SON: 'I just want to know. Please tell me, how much do you make an hour?'<br />
<br />
DAD: 'If you must know, I make $50 an hour.'<br />
<br />
SON: 'Oh,' the little boy replied, with his head down.<br />
<br />
SON: 'Daddy, may I please borrow $25?'<br />
<br />
The father was furious, 'If the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense, then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed. Think about why you are being so selfish. I don't work hard everyday for such childish frivolities. '<br />
<br />
The little boy quietly went to his room and shut the door.<br />
<br />
The man sat down and started to get even angrier about the little boy's questions. How dare he ask such questions only to get some money?<br />
<br />
After about an hour or so, the man had calmed down , and started to think:<br />
<br />
Maybe there was something he really needed to buy with that $25.00 and he really didn't ask for money very often The man went to the door of the little boy's room and opened the door.<br />
<br />
'Are you asleep, son?' He asked.<br />
<br />
'No daddy, I'm awake,' replied the boy.<br />
<br />
'I've been thinking, maybe I was too hard on you earlier' said the man. 'It's been a long day and I took out my aggravation on you. Here's the $25 you asked for.'<br />
<br />
The little boy sat straight up, smiling. 'Oh, thank you daddy!' he yelled. Then, reaching under his pillow he pulled out some crumpled up bills.<br />
<br />
The man saw that the boy already had money, started to get angry again.<br />
<br />
The little boy slowly counted out his money, and then looked up at his father.<br />
<br />
'Why do you want more money if you already have some?' the father grumbled.<br />
<br />
'Because I didn't have enough, but now I do,' the little boy replied.<br />
<br />
'Daddy, I have $50 now. Can I buy an hour of your time? Please come home early tomorrow. I would like to have dinner with you.'<br />
<br />
The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little son, and he begged for his forgiveness. <br />
<br />

While a man was polishing his new car, his 4 years old son picked up a stone and scratch lines on the side of the car.<br />
<br />
<br />
In anger, the man took the child's hand and hit it many times; not realizing he was using a wrench. At the hospital, the child lost all his fingers due to multiple fractures. +<br />
<br />
<br />
When the child saw his father.....with painful eyes he asked, 'Dad when will my fingers grow back?'<br />
<br />
<br />
The man was so hurt and speechless; he went back to his car and kicked it a lot of times.  Devastated by his own actions...sitting in front of the car he looked at the scratches; the child had written 'LOVE YOU DAD'.<br />

<br />
The next day that man committed su……….icide.<br />

A man was having an affair with a married woman. When her husband had gone to work, her secret lover came 'round. Just as they got down to business, the door bell went. The woman went and peered out of the curtains to see who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, it's my husband, he must have forgotten something.&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman went downstairs, and the man jumped out of the window before he was seen. He was totally starkers, so hid behind a bush. About an hour later, a nudist group ran by, doing a marathon. He quickly jumped up, and joined them.<br />

After a while, he got talking to one of them <br />
&quot;So how long have you been a nudist?&quot; a man asked him.<br />

Three couples went in to see the minister about becoming new members of his church. The minister said that they would have to go without sex for two weeks and then come back and tell him how it went.<br />
<br />
The first couple was retired, the second couple was middle aged and the third couple was newly married.<br />
<br />
Two weeks went by, and the couples returned to the minister.<br />
<br />
The retired couple said it was no problem at all.<br />
<br />
The middle-aged couple said it was tough for the first week, but after that it was no problem.<br />
<br />
The newlyweds said it was fine until she dropped the can of paint.<br />
<br />
''Can of PAINT!'' exclaimed the minister.<br />
<br />
''Yeah,'' said the newlywed man. ''She dropped the can and when she bent over to pick it up I had to have her right there and then. Lust took over.''<br />
<br />
The minister just shook his head and said that they were not welcome in the church.<br />

''That's okay,'' said the man. ''We're not welcome in Home Depot either.''<br />

A guy out on the golf course takes a high speed ball right in the crotch. Writhing in agony, he falls to the ground. When he finally gets himself to the doctor, he says,&quot; How bad is it doc? I'm going on my honeymoon next week and my fiancee is still a virgin in every way.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doc said , &quot;I'll have to put your penis in a splint to let it heal and keep it straight. It should be okay next week.&quot; So he took four tongue depressors and formed a neat little four-sided bandage, and wired it all together; an impressive work of art.<br />

He had been checking her out all night, but lacked the nerve to go talk to her. Suddenly she sneezed and her glass eye went flying out of its socket towards the man. With lightning quick reflexes, he caught it in mid-air.<br />
<br />
'Oh my gosh, I am so sorry,' she said as she popped her eye back in the socket. 'Let me buy you dinner to make it up to you.'<br />
<br />
They enjoyed a wonderful dinner together and afterwards the woman invited him back to her place for a drink. They went back to her house, and after some time, she took him into her bedroom and began undressing him. The couple had wild, passionate sex many times during the night. The next morning when he awoke, she had already gotten up and brought him breakfast in bed.<br />

Three couples were married and stayed at the same hotel for their honeymoons, where they were all taken care of by Dave the Bellboy.<br />
<br />
The first man married a nurse. Dave showed them to their room and thought to<br />
himself, &quot;What a lucky guy. Nurses are known to be hot to trot&quot;.<br />
<br />
The second man married a telephone operator. Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself,&quot;Wow, he's a lucky one. Telephone operators have sexy voices and once you pop that top button...Va-voom.&quot;.<br />
<br />
The third man married a school teacher.<br />
<br />
Dave showed them to their room and thought to himself, &quot;Poor guy, she's pretty but<br />
teachers are just too frigid&quot;.<br />
<br />
The next morning, Dave reported to work at 5:30 in the morning. He expected only the teacher's husband to call for breakfast any minute and the other two would call much later in the day.<br />
<br />
At 6:00 a.m. the phone rang. It was the nurse's husband<br />
wanting breakfast. The nurse's husband opened the door and Dave stepped back in shock. The man's pajamas were still pressed and his hair nicely combed. Dave asked, &quot;What<br />
happened sir? You married a nurse. The man sourly replies, &quot;Son, don't ever marry a<br />
nurse. All I heard last night was her nagging voice saying, &quot; You're not sanitary,<br />
you're not sanitary.&quot;<br />
<br />
At 6:30 a.m., the phone rang again.<br />
<br />
The telephone operator's husband called<br />
for breakfast. Dave brought it as fast as possible hoping for the best. The man opened the<br />
door and Dave stepped back in shock. The man's hair and pajamas were properly combed and<br />
pressed. Dave asked,&quot; What happened? Telephone operators are supposed to be as sexy as<br />
their voices.&quot; The man sourly replies &quot;Son, don't ever marry a telephone<br />
operator. All I heard last night was her a nasal voice saying, &quot;You're three minutes<br />
are up, your three minutes are up.&quot; Dave went back down to the desk, just knowing the<br />
teachers husband would be calling any minute.<br />
<br />
Finally at 4:30 p.m., the teacher's husband called for breakfast.<br />
<br />
Dave can't believe it but quickly took the breakfast to the couples room. The<br />
man opened the door and Dave took a step back in shock. The man was wearing only his boxers, his<br />
hair was a mess, and he had scratch marks on his chest, arms and legs. Joe fearing the worst,<br />
asked &quot; What happened to you? Did you have a fight?&quot; The man smiled and happily<br />
replied, &quot;No. Son, when you marry, be sure to marry a school teacher. All I heard last<br />
night was her sexy smooth voice saying &quot;We are going to do this over and over, until<br />
we get right.&quot;<br />

Later after supper, she goes to take her bath and she notices there is only one inch of water in the tub. She yells to her husband, &quot;HEY! There's only an inch of water in the tub.&quot; He replies, &quot;I didn't want you to get your raffle ticket wet.&quot;<br />

The first man said, ''My Benny loved to fly, so I'm going up in a plane to scatter his ashes in the sky.''<br />

The second man said, ''My Carl was a good fisherman, so I'm going to scatter his ashes in our favorite lake.''<br />

William and Mildred were<br />
married twenty-five years. They decided to celebrate with a trip to Las Vegas. When they<br />
entered the hotel/casino and registered, a sweet young woman dressed in a very short<br />
skirt, became very friendly. William brushed her off rather rudely. Mildred objected,<br />
&quot;William, she was nice, that young woman, and you were so rude.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mildred, she's a<br />
prostitute.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I don't believe you.<br />
That sweet young thing?<br />
<br />
    &quot;Let's go up to our<br />
room and I'll prove it.&quot; In their room, William called down to the desk and asked for<br />
Candie to come to room 1217.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Now,&quot; he said,<br />
&quot;you hide in the bathroom with the door open just enough to hear us, okay?&quot; She<br />
did. Soon, there was a knock on the door. William opened it and Candie walked in, swirling<br />
her hips provocatively.<br />
<br />
    &quot;So, I see you're<br />
interested after all,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
    William asked, &quot;How<br />
much do you charge?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;$125 basic rate, $100<br />
tips for special services.&quot;<br />
<br />
    William was taken aback.<br />
&quot;$125! I was thinking more in the range of $25.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Candie laughed derisively.<br />
&quot;You must really be a hick if you think you can buy sex for that price.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;Well,&quot; said<br />
William, &quot;I guess we can't do business. Goodbye.&quot; After she left, Mildred came<br />
out of the bathroom. &quot;I just can't believe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
    William said, &quot;Let's<br />
forget it. We'll go have a drink, then eat dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
    At the bar, as they sipped<br />
their cocktails, Candie came up behind William pointed slyly at Mildred, and said,<br />
&quot;See what you get for $25?&quot;<br />

A frenchman walks into a bar, smiles at the landlord and orders a glass of wine. The frenchie looks about and sees a camel sitting at the bar as well.<br />
<br />
The frenchie asks the landlord, &quot;What is that dirty camel doing in here?&quot;<br />

The Smiths had no children and decided to use a proxy father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife and said, ''I'm off. The man should be here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer rang the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. ''Good morning, madam. You don't know me but I've come to....''<br />
<br />
''Oh, no need to explain. I've been expecting you,'' Mrs. Smith cut in.<br />
<br />
''Really ?'' the photographer asked. ''Well, good! I've made a specialty of babies.''<br />
<br />
''That's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat. Just where do we start?'' asked Mrs. Smith, blushing.<br />
<br />
''Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed. Sometimes the living room floor is fun too; you can really spread out.''<br />
<br />
''Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work for Harry and me.''<br />
<br />
''Well, madam, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.''<br />
<br />
''I hope we can get this over with quickly,'' gasped Mrs. Smith.<br />
<br />
''Madam, in my line of work, a man must take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, I'm sure.''<br />
<br />
''Don't I know!'' Mrs. Smith exclaimed. The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. ''This was done on the top of a bus in downtown London.''<br />
''Oh my god!!'', Mrs. Smith exclaimed, tugging at her handkerchief.<br />
<br />
''And these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'' The photographer handed Mrs. Smith the picture.<br />
<br />
''She was difficult ?'' asked Mrs. Smith.<br />
<br />
''Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to Hyde Park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep, pushing to get a good look.''<br />
<br />
''Four and five deep?'' asked Mrs. Smith, eyes widened in amazement.<br />
<br />
''Yes,'' the photographer said.<br />
<br />
''And for more than three hours too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling. I could hardly concentrate. Then darkness approached and I began to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just packed it all in.'' Mrs. Smith leaned forward.<br />
<br />
''You mean they actually chewed on your, eh......equipment ?''<br />
<br />
''That's right. Well madam, if you're ready, I'll set up my tripod so that we can get to work.''<br />
<br />
''Tripod??'', Mrs. Smith looked extremely worried now.<br />
<br />
''Oh yes, I have to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too big for me to hold while I'm getting ready for action. Madam ? Madam?..... Good Lord, she's fainted!''<br />

A girl was going on her first date and her grandmother gave her some advice:<br />
<br />
&#8220;The boy may try to kiss you -- it will feel good, but don't do it. He may try to go up your skirt -- but don't let him. He may try to try to take your clothes off -- but don't do it. He may try to get on top of you -- but don't do it. If you do any of these things, you'll disgrace your family.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The girl said she understood and went on her date.<br />
<br />
The girl came home at about 11pm and her grandmother was waiting for her and said, &#8220;Well, did you disgrace the family.&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;Instead of letting him do those things to me, I did them to him and now it's his family that's disgraced!&#8221;</div></div><hr />

  	An expectant couple were soon to have their first child. Their doctor told them of a new invention to relieve the mother's pain during childbirth. This invention could be attached to the mother and it would transfer the pain she experienced to the baby's father.<br />
<br />
The couple talked it over and the husband was anxious to help his wife with her delivery. When the blessed time came, they opted to use the new invention. It was strapped to the mother and the dial was set at 1.<br />
<br />
With the mother's contraction, the husband felt no pain. He asked that the dial be adjusted to 3. With the next contractions, the mother felt less pain and the husband tolerated the experience well.<br />
<br />
The husband, feeling courageous and noble, asked that the dial be turned to 100%. The nurse did so and the mother completed the entire labor and delivery with no pain. The husband did not feel any pain either, and was certain that women had over-rated their plight in childbirth.<br />

Knock him out in one punch. See that dog? He has a toothache but noone can get the tooth out. Take the tooth out. See that old lady? She hasn't been screwed in a while so...screw her.&#8221;<br />

The man walks over to the drunk man and knocks him out with one punch. Then, he goes over to the dog and brings him into the back alley. The bartender hears some noises and then the man comes back in with a pair of pliers and says, &#8220;Where's the old lady with a toothache?&#8221;<br />
---new Joke---<br />
A young man was lost wandering in a forest, when he came upon a small house. He knocked on the door and was greeted by an ancient Chinese man with a long, grey beard. &quot;I'm lost,&quot; said the man. &quot;Can you put me up for the night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly,&quot; the Chinese man said, &quot;but on one condition. If you so much<br />
as lay a finger on my daughter, I will inflict upon you the three worst Chinese tortures known to man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house.<br />
<br />
Before dinner, the daughter came down the stairs. She was young,beautiful,<br />
and had a fantastic figure. She was obviously attracted to the young man since she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. Remembering the old man's warning, he ignored her and went up to bed alone. But during he night, he could bear it no longer, and sneaked into her room for a night of passion. He was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear. Near dawn he crept back to his room, exhausted, but happy.<br />
<br />
He woke to feel a pressure on his chest. Opening his eyes he saw a large<br />
rock on his chest with a note on it that read, &quot;Chinese Torture 1: Large rock on chest.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, that's pretty crappy,&quot; he thought. &quot;If that's the best the old man can do then I don't have much to worry about.&quot; He picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. As he did so he noticed another note on it that read: &quot;Chinese Torture 2: Rock tied to left testicle.&quot; In a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to the end. Figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. As he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, &quot;Chinese Torture 3: Right testicle tied to bedpost.&quot;<br />

Infuriated, I got out of my car, grabbed a tire iron out of my trunk, and walked up to the leader of the gang, a huge guy with a studded leather jacket and a chain running from his nose to his ear. As I walked up to the leader, the Biker Gang Rapists formed a circle around me. So, I ripped the leader's chain off his face and smashed him over the head with the tire iron. Layed him out. Then I turned and yelled at the rest of them, 'Leave this poor innocent girl alone! You're all a bunch of sick, deranged animals!

Once, in a small town, lived a man named Jack. Everyone in town knew Jack was very optimistic -- even if a situation was terrible, Jack could always think of a way it could be worse. Everyone in the town was tired of hearing Jack say that, so one day they decided to to lie to Jack.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack, the baker Bob found his wife in bed with another man last night! He shot the man and then himself! Isn't that terrible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, it's terrible, but it could've been worse!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How could THAT possibly have been worse?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if it had been the night before I would've been dead!&quot;<br />

These two eggs had just been married and were on their honeymoon.<br />
<br />
While they were sitting on the bed making out, the female egg pushed the male egg away and said, &quot;I just have to go to the bathroom. I'll be back in a minute.&quot; and off she went.<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, the male egg saw his sexy wife walk out in a slinky &#8216;egg&#8217;lige, wiping her hands up and down her smooth, oval-shaped body.<br />
<br />
Instantly, the male egg slapped his hands on the top of his head, covering it completely.<br />
<br />
The female egg looked at him and asked what he was doing.<br />
<br />
He replied, &quot;The last time I was this hard, someone cracked me on the head with a spoon!&quot;<br />

He spends $5,000 and feels really great about the result. On his way home he stops at a newsstand and buys a paper. Before leaving he says to the sales clerk, &quot;I hope you don't mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?&quot; &quot;About 35,&quot; was the reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm actually 47,&quot; the man says, feeling really happy.<br />

After that he goes into McDonalds for lunch, and asks the order taker the same question, to which the reply is, &quot;Oh you look about 29&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am actually 47!&quot; This makes him feel really good.<br />

While standing at the bus stop he asks an old woman the same question. She replies, &quot;I am 85 years old and my eyesight is going. But when I was young there was a sure way of telling a man's age. If I put my hand down your pants for ten minutes I will be able to tell your exact age.&quot;<br />
<br />
As there was no one around, the man thought what the hell and let her slip her hand down his pants. Ten minutes later the old lady says, &quot;OK, it's done. You are 47.&quot;<br />

A very shy guy goes into a pub on Valentine's Day night and sees a beautiful young woman sitting alone at the bar. After an hour of gathering up his courage he finally goes over to her and asks tentatively, &quot;Um, would you mind if I brought you a drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
She responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs, &quot;No, I won't sleep with you tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone in the pub started staring at them. Naturally, the guy was terribly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table totally red faced.<br />

After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles at him and says, &quot;I'm really sorry if I embarrassed you just then. You see, I'm a graduate student in psychology and I'm studying how people respond to embarrassing situations.&quot;<br />

---New Joke---<br />
Once upon a time there lived a woman who had a maddening passion for baked beans. She loved them but unfortunately they had always had a very embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction to her. Then one day she met a guy and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry she thought to herself, &quot;He is so sweet and gentlemanly, he would never go for this carrying on.&quot; So she made the supreme sacrifice, and gave up the beans.<br />
<br />
Some months later, her car broke down on the way home from work. Since she lived in the country she called her husband and told him that she would be late because she had to walk home. On her way she passed a small diner and the odor of the baked beans was more than she could stand. Since she still had miles to walk, she figured that she would walk off any ill effects by the time she reached home. So, she stopped at the diner and before she knew it, she had consumed three large orders of baked beans.<br />
<br />
All the way home she putt-putted. And upon arriving home she felt reasonably sure she could control it. Her husband seemed excited to see her and exclaimed delightedly, &quot;Darling, I have a surprise for dinner tonight.&quot; He then blindfolded her and led her to her chair at the table. She seated herself and just as he was about to remove the blindfold from his wife, the telephone rang. He made her promise not to touch the blindfold until he returned. He then went to answer the phone.<br />
<br />
The baked beans she had consumed were still affecting her and the pressure was becoming almost unbearable, so while her husband was out of the room she seized the opportunity, shifted her weight to one leg and let it go. It was not only loud, but it smelled like a fertilizer truck running over a skunk in front of pulpwood mill. She took her napkin and fanned the air around her vigorously. Then, she shifted to the other cheek and ripped three more, which reminded her of cooked cabbage. Keeping her ears tuned to the conversation in the other room, she went on like this for another ten minutes. When the phone farewells signaled the end of her freedom, she fanned the air a few more times with her napkin, placed it on her lap and folded her hands upon it, smiling contentedly to herself. She was the picture of innocence when her husband returned, apologizing for taking so long, he asked her if she peeked, and she assured him that she had not.<br />
<br />
At this point, he removed the blindfold, and she was surprised!! There were twelve dinner guests seated around the table to wish her a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;!!!<br />

One Sunday morning Joe burst into the living room and said, &quot;Dad, Mom, I have some great news for you! I am getting married to the most beautiful girl in town. She lives a block away and her name is Susan.<br />
<br />
After dinner, Joe's dad took him aside, &quot;Son, I have to talk with you.. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. She's a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe was heart-broken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, &quot;Dianne said yes! We are getting married in June.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. &quot;Diane is your half-sister too, Joe, I am very sorry about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad has done so much harm. I guess I am never going to get married&quot;, he complained. &quot;Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister.&quot;<br />

His mother just shook her head. &quot;Don't pay any attention to what he says, dear. He's not really your father.&quot;<br />

One night a wife found her husband standing over their baby's crib. Silently she watched him. As he stood looking down at the sleeping infant, she saw on his face a mixture of emotions: disbelief, doubt, delight, amazement, enchantment, skepticism.<br />
<br />
Touched by this unusual display and the deep emotions it aroused, with eyes glistening she slipped her arm around her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;A penny for your thoughts,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's amazing!&quot; he replied. &quot;I just can't see how anybody can make a crib like that for only $46.50.&quot;<br />

And all of you sons of bitches who are getting on, get your asses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks.&quot;<br />

A Minneapolis couple decided to go to Florida to thaw out during a particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years earlier.<br />
<br />
Because of hectic schedules, it was difficult to coordinate their travel plans. So, the husband left Minnesota and flew to Florida on Thursday, with his wife flying down the following day.<br />
<br />
The husband checked into the hotel. There was a computer in his room, so he decided to send an email to his wife. However, he accidentally left out one letter in her email address, and without realizing his error, sent the email.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, somewhere in Houston, a widow had just returned home from her husband's funeral. He was a minister who was called home to glory following a heart attack. The widow decided to check her email expecting messages from relatives and friends. After reading the first message, she screamed and fainted.

A drunk was sitting in a bar looking at three small brown pellets in his hand. The bartender asked what they were, and the drunk replied &quot;They are brain pills...they make you smart.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bartender says excitedly, &quot;Give me one.&quot; He snatches one from the drunks hand, and gulps it quickly down with water. In a few minutes he comes back over to the drunk and says he doesn't feel any smarter.<br />
<br />
&quot;You probably didn't take enough.&quot; So the bartender quickly gulps down another one.<br />
<br />
Half an hour later the bartender asks for a third pill. This one he looks at with more care. He sniffs it, and tastes it slowly. &quot;Why, this is nothing but sheep manure!&quot;<br />

Sleep Over:<br />
A guy walks into a drugstore and says to the pharmacist, Listen, I'm having three girls over tonight. I need help.<br />
<br />
The pharmacist hands the guy Viagra Extra Strength and says, â&#8364;&#339;Take all these and you'll go berserk for 12 hours.<br />
<br />
The next day the same guy walks into the drugstore, limps up to the pharmacist, and drops his pants. His penis is all bruised and tied in a knot, and skin is hanging off in some places. He says, gimme a tube of Icy Hot.<br />
<br />
The pharmacist replies in horror, You can't put Icy Hot on that!<br />
<br />
No, it's for my wrists, the guy moans. The girls never showed up.</div></div><hr />

Q: Doctor,  I&#8217;ve heard that  cardiovascular exercise can prolong life.  Is this true?<br />
A: Your heart only good for so many beats, and that it&#8230;..don&#8217;t waste on exercise.  Everything wear out eventually.  Speeding up heart not make you live longer; it like saying you extend life of car by driving faster.  Want to live longer?  Take nap.<br />
<br />
Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?<br />
A: You must grasp logistical efficiency.  What does cow eat?   Hay and corn.  And what are these?   Vegetables.  So steak is nothing more than efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system.  Need grain?  Eat chicken.  Beef also good source of field grass (green leafy vegetable).  And pork chop can give you 100% of recommended daily allowance of vegetable product.<br />

<br />
Q:  Aren&#8217;t fried foods bad for you?<br />
A:  YOU NOT LISTENING!  Food are fried these day in vegetable oil.  In fact, they permeated by it.  How could getting more vegetable be bad for you?!?<br />
<br />
Q:  Will  sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the middle?<br />
A: Definitely not!  When you exercise muscle, it get bigger.  You should only be doing sit-up if you want bigger stomach.<br />
<br />
