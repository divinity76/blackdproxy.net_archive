<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roxiorr</div><div class="date">03-28-2010, 12:20</div></div><div class="posttext">So blackd make tests if dash is detectable or not... If not put it in your &quot;safe cheat&quot; and you will gain more cash because ppl in war use bots only for auto healing, mana shield, timers and DASH.</div></div><hr />

Blackd, try it out .. if you added dash I bet a lot of more people would purchase the bot .. including me<br />

... it would also be great if you added auto amulet restorer, you could change it if the current amulet restorers are detectable ... example; put a new ssa in the amulet slot every x seconds ... just think outside the box, I bet you'll work something out!<br />

Can't wait to see how this project turns out! :)</div></div><hr />

u have 100% right! if dash comes to BSC it will be best bot ever!<br />
<br />
hope soon that function (and others) will come :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
let's see... maybe because it's fucking easy to detect it? if you knew how dash works, you'd understand why it's so easy to detect it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then inform me how it works and why it is so detectable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kolehti</div><div class="date">04-03-2010, 11:20</div></div><div class="posttext">since it is spamming packets lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">szyszek7</div><div class="date">04-03-2010, 13:47</div></div><div class="posttext">up: ur answer is correct i think, when u use dash ur ip spam packets and they can detect it.<br />
<br />
anyway in my opinion they are not detecting each functions of bot, they tool detect whole bot cuz ppl use them to diffrent things and all types of bot customers (from my info) get banned :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roxiorr</div><div class="date">04-03-2010, 20:28</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they detect &quot;number&quot; of packets... If you use bot you send much more because u use healing, cavebot loot picking loot droping etc... In BDSC you have only healing mana refiling  x ray and stealth so Its less packets than normal bot...<br />
ehhh Im not sure but lets blackd check dash if its detectable dont put it in your bot :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crille</div><div class="date">04-04-2010, 12:58</div></div><div class="posttext">dash sends move packets continuously without checking for player pos, which is how walking without dash works<br />
<br />
hence, easily detectable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">szyszek7</div><div class="date">04-04-2010, 13:02</div></div><div class="posttext">every1 have they own theory :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crille</div><div class="date">04-04-2010, 16:48</div></div><div class="posttext">theory? it's a fact...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimmen</div><div class="date">04-10-2010, 07:24</div></div><div class="posttext">I think u guys are putting a big preasure on daniel. Srsly he just made a new bot. And u want all functions to be implanted the next day? I would rather but with less functions than have 100 of functions that gets u banned... <br />
<br />
How are u goin to dash when u are banned? thats my question and I guess the answer is simple u cant dash when ur banned</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZBM</div><div class="date">04-12-2010, 01:04</div></div><div class="posttext">i think you dont know the concept of the word SAFE... geek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dudos</div><div class="date">06-17-2010, 17:37</div></div><div class="posttext">it is very detectable cause its sending so many more packets then normal walking... thats how i guess the detect shit ;/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree, dash should be added ... why do you guys claim it is so god damn detectable? Blackd, try it out .. if you added dash I bet a lot of more people would purchase the bot .. including me<br />
<br />
... it would also be great if you added auto amulet restorer, you could change it if the current amulet restorers are detectable ... example; put a new ssa in the amulet slot every x seconds ... just think outside the box, I bet you'll work something out!<br />

<br />
might not work as good as dash, but it should at least make some improvement :p<br />
<br />
also you cant get banned for it, yay</div></div><hr />
