Hey Jagex, check this out, this Adracius guy is a pretty nice person to chat and play, and he can also give you protection... I think. At least he is on the leading guild, I started there, but due to lack of time I'm off... but I think this month I'm gonna play there... Drop him a msg and see what you think about it... ;)</div></div><hr />
