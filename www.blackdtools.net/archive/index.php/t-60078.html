<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">provocate</div><div class="date">02-25-2013, 17:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'd love to help you, but I haven't had a premium since like March last year. :|<br />
<br />
I cannot really write scripts at premium areas for you, but I surely can explain on how I set them up so those work as perfectly as they can.<br />
<br />
About exiva commands. Of course, old scripts are OUTDATED with loads of outdated exiva commands, that's correct. But if you know what you're doing and, if you're writing a script for yourself, then there's no need to worry about exiva commands used by your own understanding. In fact, exiva commands are damn useful.<br />
<br />
Also, is this your moneymaking account? Or is it perhaps main account? Because I wouldn't use any kind of bot on my main account at all. There are some weird unannounced banishments going on in Tibia at the moment, so ya ... You never know, you know. :|</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminous</div><div class="date">02-26-2013, 03:29</div></div><div class="posttext">The account is noteven a week old lol so its not a main although its my only char at the moment so in theory it would be my main but if i can get it to 40 with that eq in a week i can do it again if i get banned but yeah i did read alot about the current banishments CIPsoft are doing which is why ive attempted to try use some more safer scripts it things like like selling items i dont have or withdrawing things i dont have etc which i believe would be a big indicator to CIP as far as botting goes just what i think<br />
<br />
well i appreciate your reply and i could use some help definetely being able to write my own hunting scripts would be most ideal <br />
the big boss man of all this has already made me one for the moment as &quot;safe&quot; as he could so il be testing that for a few days too but currently im all out of stamina xD</div></div><hr />
