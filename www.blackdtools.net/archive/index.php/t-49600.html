i never ever used before blackdproxy, i just bought it because they released  safe cheats, i dont wanted to get banned keep that in mind too people is buying now new keys because this cheat is safe, keep mind in mind too blackd is not one key forever you have to renew it too every years, others bots keys were for lifetime, also blackd normal gets you banned do you think people will buy something that gets ur banned? no, nowdays people wanna cheat safe without risk to get banned, and as i saw blackdsafe cheats i thought omg hes the best choice so i bought it never used blackdproxy.</div></div><hr />

ng is more detectable than blackd and you need to pay 10$ + ghost bot another 10$ with blackd you get everything for 10$...<br />
<br />
ghost is the same crap as bsc but low just did it with some random functions that you wont really need... like cure poison who is going to use that?? only good thing is anti-idle but im sure bsc will have it soon... i wouldnt trust low anyways...</div></div><hr />

Ghost bot isn't promised to be safe, that's just what everyone else took for granted cause he named it &quot;ghost bot&quot;.</div></div><hr />
