<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-16-2012, 19:27</div></div><div class="posttext">- it does not be related with christmas or Tibia. But such themes are good, of course.<br />
- anyone with a digital camara can take a photo to a beautifull place and that can be good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mbynens</div><div class="date">12-17-2012, 12:01</div></div><div class="posttext">Good contest! Here&#8217;s my submission:<br />
<br />
http://i.imgur.com/uqIAU.jpg<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s a crop of a picture I took last spring in Ostia, Italy during my holiday there. <br />
<br />
It also fits all the requirements:<br />
<br />
- I cropped it to 851×315px, maintaining aspect ratio<br />
- it&#8217;s a JPEG<br />
- it&#8217;s a beautiful picture IMHO &#8594; evokes positive feelings.<br />
- Bonus: it has the colors red and green, for that subtle christmassy feel ;)<br />
- it&#8217;s not offensive for anyone<br />
- I am the legal owner of that picture/photo (verify using TinEye/Google Image search: 0 similar results. I have never uploaded this image before)<br />
- You have my permission to use it as a background for the text of gift cards and to use it on your Facebook page</div></div><hr />

This picture was taken during my trip to Scotland, at the Isle of Skye (Most beautiful place I've ever been, really worth visiting). The combination of the insane landscape and the rainbow makes this picture look peaceful. It impresses me every time I see it, and i'm more than happy to share this picture in this contest.<br />
<br />
Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">12-20-2012, 13:26</div></div><div class="posttext">nice photos!<br />
<br />
Btw, I should warn that this contest will be closed today at 23:59 and then poll will begin tomorrow.<br />
If someone still want to join please hurry up! You still have some hours left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gordon75</div><div class="date">12-20-2012, 19:32</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
Well, as I couldn't participate in the 2011 contest because of a misunderstand on the top-end date format, this year I come in time to show you some of my artworks, so I hope you like them :)<br />
<br />
1 - The first one is a ver old castle which was built in Spain in the XII century (year 1122) in the town where I live.<br />
7643<br />
<br />
2 - The second picture is a photo of my cousin's house on the beach. Not very useful now in winter, but it could be a nice point for the next summer.<br />
7644<br />
<br />
3 - The third one comes from a wallpaper I made for a Tibia fansite, so there are some dragons on it :p<br />
7645<br />
<br />
4 - The fourth image is a mix of an artwork that I made for my Twitter account and a 3D model of a 0&#8364; note that I made for one of my webpages. It is a bit &quot;abstract&quot;, but I think it might become handy in some cases :D<br />
7646<br />
<br />
5 - And finally, the last one is a crop of the wallpaper that I couldn't submit to the 2011 contest. Mixing Christmas, Tibia &amp; BlackdTools, is there a better combination for these days? ;)<br />
7647<br />
<br />
<br />
So I wish good luck to all participants and I hope you all have a nice time this Christmas with your family/friends!<br />
<br />
Edit: btw, I forgot to say that all pictures were shot/edited/made by me or mixed up with non copyrighted images (such as the dragons in picture 3), and all of them were also photoshoped by me to give extra fx/fixes.<br />
<br />
Merry christmas &amp; kindest regards!</div></div><hr />

Merry Christmas to all!</div></div><hr />
