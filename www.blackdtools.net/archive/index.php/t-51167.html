Agnes and I dont remember her middle and last name, but her boyfriend in tibia cormifed that and everybody is saying about it in Libera's forum.<br />
<br />
In the website is saying that she fell down of the third floor from a building that she used to live with their uncles, the family is thinking of someone push her but I think that she committed suicide<br />
<br />
And Satanas is saying that he called in her mother's house and confirmed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its surprising how life can change in 1 day and you die at the best age<br />
how old was she? 19? <br />
i remember her avatar (idk if it was pink~) but if it was then she was a true beauty and its always sad to see happen this to someone ...<br />
<br />
may she find peace in heaven now &lt;3</div></div><hr />

<br />
(She) Wasn't that beautiful. And wasn't loyal too, her bf in-game discovered that she were probably cheating on him IRL and then he stole her items/broke up the e-love. Now add that to a cyber bulling she suffered on 5 years by having nude pics spread of her on the internet: I cogit suicide.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to say but I hardly believe she even had friends to pull her from the window like the news says.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough I though she were happy now with this new bf, strange how people are dying on the inside and pretending everything is ok...<br />

ye it really would.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shanera</div><div class="date">06-30-2010, 15:11</div></div><div class="posttext">this is really sad she couldnt be happy irl with her bf, and that it was not possible to her to live with her e-love... hope it was not the only reason for her to suicide, many girls are too sick and think about romance and love and etc bla bla bla, theres not much place for that nowadays, only get them hurt<br />
<br />
that must hurt alot having an real dedicated e-love and yet being betrayed by exposing her privacy...<br />
<br />
here is some exemple from shanera,don't post this crap here, i really dont understand but 1 year after those pictures go to net the girl was breaking/backing to the guy who exposed her like this, really strange for me, very sad if she couldnt leave him<br />
<br />
ive had an small e-love in which i was a bastard too, ive made the poor girl naked in cam, expecting it was strentening our relationship, but some time later it ended and now i regret this shit i did to her, it should have been with someone that were going to be with her forever</div></div><hr />

There should be a condelance thread,<br />
