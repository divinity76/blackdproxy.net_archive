Have not played tibia for years but I hear about all the change since I left (around when there was a jungle added to the Darama desert) and I want to bot a char to get a feel for it and maybe kill some ruling guild PA's witch I hate.<br />

I would be thankful if the community could answer these questions:<br />
1. I seem unable to join the 2x world, why? and should I?<br />
2. I seem unable to get Blackd to work/connect to my client. Can not get the character name up in the cavebot screen for example? Tried starting Blackd first and also tried starting tibia first.. what could it be?<br />
3. Recommend me a European world, I want : Little PA and PK, english speaking players, ability to bot semi-afk<br />
4. What do I need to know regarding what gets you banned and not? In case I missed something. I've understood the gist of it (Sending packages unable to be sent without cheating tools)<br />
5. I am going to be a Druid or Sorcerer, when I played they were the same except sorcerers had some more attack spells, how is it now?<br />

I am going to make a botting diary project on this forum, so check in on me there on my quest to lvl 1000 ;)</div></div><hr />

Thanks Blackd, but still not working. I re-installed using the installer as admin (Im pretty sure this was default anyway)<br />
I start Blackd Proxy, then I start tibia using the MC button to ensure it is the correct version I've got in the settings (Program files/Tibia)<br />
Either way, it just wont connect, I remember that you got a clear message when Blackd Proxy had launched successfully back in before tibia 8.0 when I bought it, but this does not happen, neither does my character name appear in the cavebot list.<br />
<br />
I am using Microsoft security essentials AND I've made Blackd and Tibia an exception there...<br />
I am not sure what more info I can give that would help..<br />
I am not running blackd proxy as admin, if I do, it wont run<br />
I am not running Tibia as admin<br />
I have tried starting tibia first, or blackd first or logging in with/without blackd on but I seem to recall that it just simply worked back in the days.<br />
As I have tried to run Tibia from Blackd Proxy it must be the correct version?<br />
<br />
thank you if you can help me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giwi</div><div class="date">02-07-2013, 09:58</div></div><div class="posttext">And windows firewall is off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">02-07-2013, 19:04</div></div><div class="posttext">Step 1; Try fresh Uninstall Tibia &amp; BlackD<br />
<br />
Step 2; Install Tibia and update it fully. ( Atleast play from the original client 1x )<br />
<br />
Step 3; Install BlackD Proxy 9.81 for latest version of Tibia.<br />
<br />
Step 4; Open BlackD Proxy, Let it automatically choose the directory of Tibia and find the .exe to run the game.<br />
<br />
Step 5; Open Tibia MC and Enjoy.<br />
<br />
I will think on any other problems I could possibly think of, but It may just need a clean install/reboot if the anti-virus is not your issue.<br />

<br />
this is the warning picture I get when running as admin.<br />
<br />
1. Fresh install<br />
2. Switching the MSWINSCK.OCX file against one from the internet will not fix problem<br />
3. Installer ran in admin mode<br />
<br />
What could it be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giwi</div><div class="date">02-07-2013, 20:34</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so that error code took me to this page:<br />
http://www.blackdtools.net/showthread.php?16977-Possible-solutions-for-errors-429-or-339-(Windows-Vista-Windows-7)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it only got more complicated here.<br />
<br />
Solution 1 and 2 does not work as they are supposed to not run as admin and when I do that it doesnt work<br />
Solution 3 I did and when I came to the very last part of the cmd writings (regsvr32 dx7vb.dll) it wouldent allow me<br />
but suddenly it worked to run as admin but the bot isnt connecting to the tibia character still...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried that, but thanks.<br />
<br />
I also tried installing the stuff from Common Installer : VB6 dlls and ocxs in the download page.<br />
<br />
Note: it works to run blackd as an admin now, but the same problem remains..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">02-10-2013, 22:43</div></div><div class="posttext">you should uninstall any antivirus or firewall that might be causing the problem.<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials should not be a problem. It never gave me any problem.<br />
<br />
You can also try disabling UAC in your user account settings, then restart windows then reinstall blackd and try again.</div></div><hr />
