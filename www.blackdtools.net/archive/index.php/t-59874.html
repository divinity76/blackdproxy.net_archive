<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithium</div><div class="date">01-03-2013, 19:33</div></div><div class="posttext">BlackD is a very intricate bot, I do not like to tell people with little to none knowledge of BlackD that it is safe.. IF you use it properly with just its certain features like auto-eat, auto-heals, auto-equip items on your Main fine, Using Cavebot on FACCs ( Knights mainly ) for cash making is the best bet with BlackD, other then that I really only suggest using the Cavebot and creating your own scripts for your free accounts or you may end up running an out-dated script and getting yourself the ban hammer..Just my two cents.<br />
