<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razoor</div><div class="date">01-19-2012, 18:08</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't really think its ninja patches to ban botters, i think its part of the updating of the events ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackd</div><div class="date">01-19-2012, 19:00</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right. Today there was another ninja patch of tibia.dat<br />
If you have Blackd Proxy 22.2 then don't worry about that thing anymore. Blackd Proxy will autoupdate the tibia.dat so it should keep building correct packets after it.<br />
Now you only need to update Blackd Proxy when tibia version changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xHellsx</div><div class="date">01-19-2012, 19:52</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is for the event, but if you experience anything from the event without the new .dat file then blackdproxy may do something stupid and get detected!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldpot</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 03:57</div></div><div class="posttext">i think there encrypting somthing in tibi.dat because I got all accounts banned today and the reason they where detected from tibia automated detecting system tey can trell if ur a bot or not through this stamina system. Get ur gold and switch it to main acc dont bot on main acc unless u wanna get banned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeverX</div><div class="date">01-20-2012, 09:48</div></div><div class="posttext">I also think these small patches are released because of 15th anniversary ... My normal procedure these days is to run a Tibia without any bot going on and let it update itself or sometimes I even download latest version, which probably contains that 'ninja' patch. I usually run Tibia twice manually and after that when I'm sure it's updated I start up BlackD Proxy 22.2 and start botting ... It seems that works, dunno for how long, we'll see. :P</div></div><hr />
