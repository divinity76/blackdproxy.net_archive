Today, i've entered in game, and the account had been hacked(only the one I used with this program). 
 
Suspicious, do not you think? luckily it was a free account. 
 
My recommendation: Do not trust this guy, and do not use this program in your account, especially if you are premium... I've really been a big disappointment." />

<br />
blackd have been around for years, I highly doubt that he would risk his reputation for some shitty items when he probably have 1000kk+</div></div><hr />
