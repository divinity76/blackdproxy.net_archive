<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">10-08-2010, 20:09</div></div><div class="posttext">Haha, seemed interesting to me, want to see some answers. :P<br />
Moving to General Chat.<br />
<br />
Gonna answer later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larron</div><div class="date">10-08-2010, 20:12</div></div><div class="posttext">thank you :) hoping it goes well from here on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blade</div><div class="date">10-08-2010, 21:33</div></div><div class="posttext">1. In MMORPGs, what do you deem as cheating, and why? I deem cheating as anything that is not a part of the client in the first place that can be used to gain an unfair advantage. The reason is because its simply just unfair.<br />
<br />
2. Do you think &#8220;Botting&#8221; should be categorized as cheating? Why? Yes I do think that botting should be considered cheating due to the fact it is almost completely automated allowing people to live their lives and then come play a game they have done nothing to gain their current position in the game.<br />
<br />
3. As the EULA within the majority MMORPG&#8217;s has been enforced to disallow the use of &#8220;bots&#8221;, why continue to use them? The reason that I myself use bots is because the game is simple but the addiction is strong so why not distance yourself such as doing your day to day activities and then only playing the game in spare time... By using the bot you still get the money you need from your cashmaker chars but you don't spend hours doing so of your own free time you could be spending with friends family and stuff of that nature. The reason to still use them is because losing one char is nothing when you made that char to do exactly that get gold and get banned. Yes being banned is a pain but you can have a new char in its place in a few hours.<br />
<br />
4. What are the benefits of using &#8220;bots&#8221; and do you think they outweigh the involved risks? Why?The benefits are pretty obvious. You can do some things more than humanly possible. And you can have all of it done for you while you are not even at a computer.<br />
<br />
5. Do you use any other forms of &#8220;game exploits&#8221;? Why or why not? For right now I do not and the reason for this is I dont play PC games to much.<br />
<br />
6. Do you have any expectations from the various &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors? If so, have your expectations been met? I have one expectation and that is for them to try to provide the best product they can. They are all trying so yes my personal expectations have been met.<br />
<br />
7.How has the anti-cheating tools or mass bans affected you and your relationship with the &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors? Nope not at all A few chars isn't a problem for me.<br />
<br />
8. How has your &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributor acted in response to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why? Blackd has started coming up with bots that use different methods of client manipulation. The reason for this is due to the theories of how the mass banns work.<br />
<br />
9. Why do you think numerous &#8220;botting&#8221; distributors have stopped releasing the source code of available &#8220;bots&#8221;? That is simple it is their code, their bot, their product, their income. Another reason would be if you know how something works you know its weakness. What I'm trying to say is if you knew how it was codded you would know how to detect the code flaws<br />
<br />
10. How have you responded to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why? I have eased up on my botting I just do summoners and cash makers now. Never my main.  Just a little worried about my main :P.<br />
<br />
11. Why do you choose to &#8220;Bot&#8221;? To have a real life away from the computer.<br />
<br />
12. With the introduction of the anti-botting tools, numerous MMORPG&#8217;s experienced mass bans, what do you suppose triggered numerous &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors response to release new &#8220;Bots&#8221; and have they been effective. ? Why or why not? The reason for bot creators to release new bots is due to the fact their old form of client manipulation was getting caught so basically they are trying something new to keep their businesses going. Why? Its a form of income for the creators they have 2 choices stop trying to get their bots to work or stop gaining money from the buyers.<br />
<br />
13. Have the &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors required any formal input or assistance from you as a player? If so, how and why? From me no but in the past i have seen bot creators making post about possible ways to get around encryption's and stuff of that nature of course they did pay the people that provided them the info be it with real money or with tibia money.<br />
<br />
Hope you get a good grade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larron</div><div class="date">10-08-2010, 22:39</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, your thoughts are really insightfull. Really look forward to reading the posts to follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaPoZaUm</div><div class="date">10-08-2010, 23:06</div></div><div class="posttext">1. In MMORPGs, what do you deem as cheating, and why?<br />
I think cheating is using things or ways that the game-law or even the ppl who play that game disapproves.<br />
<br />
2. Do you think &#8220;Botting&#8221; should be categorized as cheating? Why?<br />
Yeah, as you'll get the benefit without doing the effort.<br />
<br />
3. As the EULA within the majority MMORPG&#8217;s has been enforced to disallow the use of &#8220;bots&#8221;, why continue to use them?<br />
The only MMORPG I played was Tibia, and it's a BORING game. I think ppl want to avoid this nuisance. Also the huge benefit with a small effort, as I said above.<br />
<br />
4. What are the benefits of using &#8220;bots&#8221; and do you think they outweigh the involved risks? Why?<br />
Not having to do the same thing ten million times, as drag the loot or clicking on the battle list. Not having to care about healing yourself and your friends.<br />
The only risk would be get caught by a GM (when I played) so the chance was like 0.<br />
<br />
5. Do you use any other forms of &#8220;game exploits&#8221;? Why or why not?<br />
The Multiclient? To play more than one character at one time.<br />
<br />
6. Do you have any expectations from the various &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors? If so, have your expectations been met?<br />
Not really, Tibia is not on my top priorities. Anyway, a safe cavebot would be nice.<br />
<br />
7.How has the anti-cheating tools or mass bans affected you and your relationship with the &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors?<br />
I quitted for good, but I already did before they released this &quot;measures&quot;.<br />
The only distributor I really care is blackd, so I kept visiting his forum.<br />
<br />
8. How has your &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributor acted in response to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why?<br />
Blackd released recently a soft version of his bot, but safe. That's cool for those who still play, but the BOT itself(the cavebot) isn't included yet. Blackd shows that he's still up to the challenge of creating a full and safe Proxy.<br />
<br />
9. Why do you think numerous &#8220;botting&#8221; distributors have stopped releasing the source code of available &#8220;bots&#8221;?<br />
Well, as Blade said: it's their property. I wouldn't release if I made a working bot. Maybe to a few that I trust to make improvements.<br />
<br />
10. How have you responded to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why?<br />
I laughed on the first wave. Laughed hard. Then I got worried about friends who stood playing. :P Afterall I gave up playing Tibia.<br />
<br />
11. Why do you choose to &#8220;Bot&#8221;?<br />
To avoid the time-waste. I was too young when I started playing Tibia. Had time to lose and friends to motivate me. Today I gotta study on college and care about the woman I love and family. <br />
<br />
12. With the introduction of the anti-botting tools, numerous MMORPG&#8217;s experienced mass bans, what do you suppose triggered numerous &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors response to release new &#8220;Bots&#8221; and have they been effective. ? Why or why not? <br />
No clue, I'd say the complaining was too high. They we're afraid of being named a Bot Game. I think the cracking of shitty bots as NG and Elf also made it worse. I live in Brazil and I know some MEGA noobs who used to bot because it was too easy to find it on the web.<br />
<br />
13. Have the &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors required any formal input or assistance from you as a player? If so, how and why? <br />
Never from me. Blackd always kept an eye on the proposal board here but today most things are impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: If I could return to the past, like 7-8 years from now, I'd buy a blackd license and bot from even earlier than I actually did.<br />
^^<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crille</div><div class="date">10-09-2010, 01:04</div></div><div class="posttext">1. In MMORPGs, what do you deem as cheating, and why?<br />
Anything that gives a player an unfair advantage. Although I would not deem software for gaming mouses as cheating, nor a keyboard/mouse hook<br />
<br />
2. Do you think “Botting” should be categorized as cheating? Why?<br />
Absolutely, it has the biggest impact on unfairness.<br />
<br />
3. As the EULA within the majority MMORPG’s has been enforced to disallow the use of “bots”, why continue to use them?<br />
I'd like to answer this with a counter-question, why would the creators of the game make it so easy to bot? Tibia is one huge grindfest from start to finish, had it been more quest-oriented like World of Warcraft, botting would simply not pay off nearly as much as it does today.<br />
<br />
4. What are the benefits of using “bots” and do you think they outweigh the involved risks? Why?<br />
It's obvious, the benefit is unfair advantage. Whether it's worth the risk totally depends on the game creator's efforts to stop botting, for example: would I bot in World of Warcraft? Fuck no, not with their the anti-bot software and their ruthless GMs. Tibia? Yeah, it's lucrative to bot (moneymakers) even if they get banned eventually.<br />
<br />
5. Do you use any other forms of “game exploits”? Why or why not?<br />
Memory hacks (i.e. lighthack), since they do not classify as a bot.<br />
<br />
6. Do you have any expectations from the various “Botting” distributors? If so, have your expectations been met?<br />
As a bot dev myself I'm surprised there are no better bots on the market, ElfBot was pretty good though but even ElfBot had much room for improvement.<br />
<br />
7.How has the anti-cheating tools or mass bans affected you and your relationship with the “Botting” distributors?<br />
I'm self-sufficient of bot software, so I haven't been desperate like many others. Although due to the software CipSoft has introduced, alot of discussion (from developers, not from people who have no clue) has spawned and it has been interesting and fun to try to find solutions to this problem.<br />
<br />
8. How has your “Botting” distributor acted in response to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why?<br />
Self-sufficient, so can't answer that.<br />
<br />
9. Why do you think numerous “botting” distributors have stopped releasing the source code of available “bots”?<br />
As far as I know there haven't been that many complete bots that have been open source in the first place, although nowadays there is TibiaAPI so basically anyone can make a bot.<br />
<br />
10. How have you responded to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why?<br />
I have met it with great interest as I like challenges in programming, this being a most enjoyable challenge as it will improve my software and knowledge.<br />
<br />
11. Why do you choose to “Bot”?<br />
Lazyness and to improve my own software.<br />
<br />
12. With the introduction of the anti-botting tools, numerous MMORPG’s experienced mass bans, what do you suppose triggered numerous “Botting” distributors response to release new “Bots” and have they been effective. ? Why or why not?<br />
These new bots have in my opinion been rushed out to make money, as there is no proof that bots using keystrokes and mouseclicks are any safer than previous methods. The only problem it takes care of is malformed packets.<br />
<br />
13. Have the “Botting” distributors required any formal input or assistance from you as a player? If so, how and why?<br />
As a bot dev I don't require assistance from non-programmers, although I do very much like suggestions on how to improve certain features</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larron</div><div class="date">10-09-2010, 09:08</div></div><div class="posttext">It really fascinating reading your replies. All you thoughts were and still is highly appreciated. Hoping to get a few more today :). Cant wait to see what comes up next :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larron</div><div class="date">10-09-2010, 14:10</div></div><div class="posttext">Fingers are crossed i get a couple more replies to the questions :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keno</div><div class="date">10-09-2010, 15:20</div></div><div class="posttext">Omg... That cannot be true :(. When I wanted to send post (all questions answered) my computer did reset. I will maybe answer it all once again later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larron</div><div class="date">10-09-2010, 16:00</div></div><div class="posttext">:) thanks mate, appreciate it, cant wait to hear your thoughts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavokD</div><div class="date">10-09-2010, 19:31</div></div><div class="posttext">1. In MMORPGs, what do you deem as cheating, and why? Cheating is the abuse of some fault in a programs code, or use of an external program that gives the user a fairly good advantage over the ones that dont use them.<br />
<br />
2. Do you think &#8220;Botting&#8221; should be categorized as cheating? Why? Yes, it gives a great advantage by doing nothing. The game was not meant to be played that way, thats why I consider botting as cheating.<br />
<br />
3. As the EULA within the majority MMORPG&#8217;s has been enforced to disallow the use of &#8220;bots&#8221;, why continue to use them? Because people love to outbid the rules.<br />
<br />
4. What are the benefits of using &#8220;bots&#8221; and do you think they outweigh the involved risks? Why? Yeah they do outweigh the risks. The benefits are that you can enjoy a fairly powerful character by almost doing nothing. If you get caught, you can start a new character, the bot will continue to do the stuff for yourself anyways.<br />
<br />
5. Do you use any other forms of &#8220;game exploits&#8221;? Why or why not? I like testing games. Im not talking about MMORPGs, but general console videogames. If I hear about a glitch or exploit on a game I own, I always try to reproduce it. <br />
<br />
6. Do you have any expectations from the various &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors? If so, have your expectations been met? Yeah,  blackd delivers<br />
<br />
7.How has the anti-cheating tools or mass bans affected you and your relationship with the &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors? I have been more cautious on using them but I have not ended the relationship. I love this forums and I will stay as long as I can, tho I cant say for sure that I have had a &quot;good relationship&quot; with Daniel himself.<br />
<br />
8. How has your &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributor acted in response to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why? All I can say is that he acted aggressively.<br />
<br />
9. Why do you think numerous &#8220;botting&#8221; distributors have stopped releasing the source code of available &#8220;bots&#8221;? Because they see this as a profitable business, and they dont want competitors.<br />
<br />
10. How have you responded to the anti-cheating tools and mass bans? Why? I stopped playing. I lost interest.<br />
<br />
11. Why do you choose to &#8220;Bot&#8221;? Cos it lets me do other stuff while watching my char level up.<br />
<br />
12. With the introduction of the anti-botting tools, numerous MMORPG&#8217;s experienced mass bans, what do you suppose triggered numerous &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors response to release new &#8220;Bots&#8221; and have they been effective. ? Why or why not? Distributors may have felt that cipsoft found some stuff on their code that they could use to tell if someone was botting or not. Distributors were forced then to start clean other bots with new code. At least on BlackD's part it has been effective.<br />
<br />
13. Have the &#8220;Botting&#8221; distributors required any formal input or assistance from you as a player? If so, how and why? Yeah, BlackD has always asked for input, he wants his bot to be the very best. Like no bot ever was. To level them is my real test<br />
To train them is my cause (ooooooh).</div></div><hr />
