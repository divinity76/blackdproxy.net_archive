It is NOT a safe cavebot. It is detected by autodetection system at this moment. However it still can help you to make big gold for your main char before the deletion wave! :)<br />
Note: don't cavebot with the main char!</div></div><hr />

What yopu should be doing untill he cave botter is more safe is making character's adn account getting them to bank gold then switch that gold to another to another to a safe that no bot then keep doing untill eventually a new safe cave botter has been released that is safe enough this is just a cautious thing to do.  If you don't care and think your invincible and yuor cavebot scripts are outmatched for tibia client to catch you then go right a head. Have not even saw any new bots out with macro cave botter. There is a method I can tell you about. Automation anywhere you can script cavebot scripts then compile them to programs and run them. Just google automation anywhere.</div></div><hr />
