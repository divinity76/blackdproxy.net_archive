Young people 13 to 19 years, are more watching porn and selfish sexual than having sex with their partners.. This is the conclusion of a study of the regional media authorities of Lower Saxony and Bavaria. Was investigated namely the surfing behavior of adolescents. Results: watching porn on the net is part of everyday life. <br />
<br />
The authors of the study even come to the result that there is  more porn to be seen, and less &quot;operated real sex&quot; is. One possible explanation: The guys look so much porn that they are tired of real sex - especially if the girls do not look then like the Californian beauties from the movies.</div></div><hr />

Depends how is trained your mind, true imagination is hard to reach.<br />
<br />
pr0n is better, you don't have to be worry about your complexes or either about premade ejaculation (effects of Pr0n).<br />

Porn is great for... How should i put this? Training?<br />
<br />
<br />
Porn should not be an alternative it should be a tool. Teach your self how to last longer. Teach yourself how to do different things to your girl.<br />

I get laid when ever i want but i still find the time to beat my shit daily. Because by doing this I can Work on holding off for the &quot;big finish&quot;.<br />

If all you do is watch porn to finish off alone and not work on it for someone else i see that as a fail.<br />
