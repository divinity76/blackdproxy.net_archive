Before BlackD I was using NG and as I remember correct, everything was ok. Then I purchased BlackD and of course I wanted to bot like crazy with Cavebot. I learned (or is it learnt? who knows lol!) how to set up Cavebot so I was botting quite successfuly, but I noticed that BlackD cavebot &quot;moves&quot; so damn slow ... dunno, but other botting programs run so smoothly compared to BlackD" />
