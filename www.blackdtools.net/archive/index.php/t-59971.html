I am almost sure that this new function should now work for everybody. Or at least it should work for more persons than before.</div></div><hr />

that is really strange. if you get the red welcome msg it means it was able to read/write memory correctly so it can't be a problem with the latest change.<br />

Your cheats probably got paused because a command or because one of your scripts or because a debug. if you got a debug please send me the file errors.txt to my email: daniel@blackdtools.com</div></div><hr />

your antivirus is probably messing with blackd proxy. It probably deleted part of it. try uninstalling it. Install Microsoft Security Essentials instead.<br />
<br />
Anyways try reinstalling blackd proxy in default folder. if it does not work then try installing it in C:\blackdproxy<br />
<br />
and retry login a few times, just in case. it usually does not connect at first attempt.</div></div><hr />
