The Beatles song 'With A Little Help From My Friend' also reached number one in the UK three times, although not by the Beatles themselves. Firstly for Joe Cocker in 1968, then by Wet Wet Wet in 1988. Finally hitting the top spot again for Sam and Mark in 2004.<br />

'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen has reached the number one spot in the UK in four different years. Originally released in 1975, it reached the top spot in November and was still there in early 1976. After lead singer, Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, the song was re-released, hitting number one in December of that year and holding on until late January of 1992.</div></div><hr />
