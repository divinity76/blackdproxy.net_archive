I would like to use the bot to train my knight with gargoyles, just train. Do you think it's totally safe to use the bot just for this purpose?<br />
Second question. I never used the bot from Blackdtools before, altough I always bought gold from here and appreciated Daniel's work. Can someone post a script to knight train with gargoyles? It would have to switch the attack between gargoyles, kill any other possible lured creatures (switching for a better weapon), eat food and heal if necessary. I think that's enough, right?<br />
I could try doing the script myself, since I have some experience with other bots, but I read some posts talking about scripts sending outdated codes, what is horrible considering the automatic detection system, and I got scared....<br />
<br />
So, if someone consider that the script I'm suggesting is simple and not risky, and also thinks to have the knowledge required to build the script in a way that the bot would behave just like a human would do, please, help me.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Why dont you train like a normal person does instead of trying to make it ridiculously hard? Not to mention the losses you will take if the creature DOES end up killing you. Stop exping for a single week, buckle down and train simple as that.<br />
