	<meta name="description" content="I was told to post on forums about requesting people to a team in Solera. 
Our team/guild now consists of more than 25+ players now. 
 
We only want serious players/botters to join us, and we would prefer mages/paladins (None of this join for a week then quit nonsense) But Knights are more than welcome to join too :rolleyes:  I will tell you that we are allied with one of the leading guilds in Solera, So please contact me via PM/Post here. Or via msn. 
 
Also anyone who joins us will be set up" />
